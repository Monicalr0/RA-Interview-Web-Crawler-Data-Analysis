*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

Thank you for helping us to help you better!","

trim() not working,"FCI: (Added by Mod from User's Sig.)
My Config: iMacros Browser 11.5 DESKTOP; Windows 7

>>>

I'm extracting data that contains spaces, and so I use the trim() function to removes the spaces.

But It doesn't work!

Here's a sample code :
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=11.5.499.3066
TAB T=1
TAB CLOSEALLOTHERS

SET !VAR0 <SP><SP><SP><SP><SP><SP>Hi<SP>
SET someVar EVAL(""var some='{{!VAR0}}'.trim(); some;"")
PROMPT {{someVar}}

The code above should work normally but it returns this error :
Error -1250: JScript statement in EVAL contains the following error: Objects of type 'System.String' do not have such a member. Line 6: SET someVar EVAL(""var some='{{!VAR0}}'.trim(); some;"")

JavaScript does have trim() function and it works on IE and all browsers!

UPDATE : Apparently It works on FireFox Add-on but not on the iMacros Desktop Browser. Why doesn't it work on the iMacros Browser, which is supposed to be superior than the free add-ons ?!!","

Hi Blakero,

Support for the trim() function is dependent on the version of the Javascript engine in use. It looks like you recorded your macro with an older version of the iMacros browser, and hence trim() is not available. However, you can use the replace() function with a regular expression to achieve the same result. An example is provided under the Manipulate extraction section on the EVAL command reference page.","

How to extract data from CTRL+C,"Hi, I'm new to iMacros. I'm using iMacros VERSION BUILD=1011 Personal edition on Chrome 108.0.5359.125 64bit on Windows 10 Pro
I have a problem to copy text from some text boxes. I tried many ways and the only way to copy it is CTRL+C in EVENT mode. My code looks like this:
Code: Select all'select all

Then I tried manually pasting the text, it worked. It copied the text correctly. What I want is to extract that copied text to save it as CSV file. How can I do this? Please help.

Dynamic Frame Tracking,"Configuration: Surface Pro 2, Win 10, Firefox 53, iMacros Standard Edition (x86) Version 11.0.246.4051
Hi,
 I extract data from a web page and in the last few months the frame number (no frame names that refer to table) seems to vary from numbers 14-18 every few days/weeks.  My work around now is to manually change number.  I would like to able to have macro handle that, but I can't figure out how to do it. The original macro has 300 lines of code and I need to access this particular frame twice, line 47 and then again at line 234.  Ideally the macro would determine frame number, then store in variable for second access.  I have searched the web and I know there are scripting solutions out there but I am confused/unsure how to specifically code and then incorporate script into the existing macro: ie: Run firstpart.iim, run framenumber.js, then run finalpart.iim??
Thanks

Help with XPath,"I'm relatively new to iMacros and identifying XPaths is proving a problem. Some I am able to do either inspecting the element in Chrome or using the XPath Helper extension. However, this particular one is proving a problem and I would appreciate some help.

I want to simply obtain the navlist__item-title from here:
Code: Select all<div class=""navlist__item-title"">St George's Church</div>

So how do I achieve this so I can include the XPath in a TAG command?

Multiple HREF,"VERSION BUILD=1011 TRIAL VERSION
Windows 10 64 bit
Chrome Version 106.0.5249.103

Hello, I've been exploring into multiple possibilities in iMacros, and I'm pretty impressed with how much time it has saved me. I'm now working on a new script that would extract numerous HREF, open them in new tabs, and then shut them. The issue is that the first HREF only worked, and the subsequent HREF didn't function at all. Can more than one HREF be extracted using a single script, like !VAR1, !VAR2? The sample script I'm using is shown below.
Code: Select allTAG POS=2 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=TXT:Visit
TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:Clickhere EXTRACT=HREF
TAB OPEN
TAB T=2
URL GOTO={{!EXTRACT}}
TAB T=1
TAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=TXT:Back
TAG POS=2 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=TXT:Visit
TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:Clickhere EXTRACT=HREF

Write YES or No in CVS if script runs properly,"VERSION BUILD=1011 TRIAL VERSION
Windows 10 64 bit
Chrome Version 106.0.5249.103

I've been using this platform for more than a week and have already created some fantastic scripts that make my job much easier. iMacros runs flawlessly, but the website we work on occasionally doesn't, thus I'm wondering if there's a method we can export if the loop was correctly completed or not and then export it to CSV or Directly to Excel so when loop is finished then we can check which Loop number we should do manual because it was not executed properly.

I'll use the same script I did in my most recent post. viewtopic.php?f=7&p=89250#p89250
Code: Select allTAG POS=2 TYPE=DIV ATTR=TXT:Visit
TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:Clickhere
TAB T=2
TAB T=1
TAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=TXT:Back
TAG POS=2 TYPE=DIV ATTR=TXT:Visit
TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:Clickhere
TAB T=2
TAB T=1
TAB CLOSEALLOTHERS

To help you understand what I'm trying to accomplish, I've attached the screenshot below. It indicates that if lines 2 and 7 were properly run, the spreadsheet's row labeled ""LOOP 1"" should display ""YES,"" and if not, ""NO."" By this, after the loop was done we can see which one should we check back again and do manually the work instead of checking then one by one on the website and check if it done properly.","

How to use iMacros to add HTML tag values in new line or Edit existing tag,"Google Chrome: Version 105.0.5195.102 (Official Build) (64-bit)
iMacros: 2021
System: Windows 10 Pro 21H2 19044.1949

There's a dropdown selection box with multiple preset tag values for user selection. However, I need a tag value with my own range value=""30.0 To 70.0"">30.0 To 70.0 which is not available.

How can I add a new tag value (new line) OR edit the existing to modify my required range by using iMacros Browser.

I've read a few similar post & solutions by Guru Shugar but those are for adding ""value"" into an empty field and another is to remove attribute ""disabled"" which is not what i required.

Any help will be much appreciated. Thanks.

How to extract dynamic table rows with loop & stop when reach a specific condition,"Google Chrome: Version 105.0.5195.102 (Official Build) (64-bit)
iMacros: 2021 
System: Windows 10 Pro 21H2 19044.1949

With Guru chivracq kind guidance from my earlier post viewtopic.php?f=7&t=32028, i'm able to extract required data with unique element style=""background-color: orange;"" by using 'Double Relative Positioning' instead of using Xpath.

Since the data table is dynamic with 15mins refresh interval, the total of rows will change from each refresh. I've tried to search for solution & study eval() from the forum posts (especially Guru chivracq solutions) but i'm still not able to grasp the technic somehow   

Here again, I hope to have more guidance to find the solution. 

Questions:-
1. Is there a way to make a loop instead of the way i'm using as per code below eg. 'Extract 1st rows, 'Extract 2nd rows and so on?
2. The extraction should be stopped when reached <tr class=""montage_atm_bottom even"", how can i achieve this?

My current code:-
Code: Select allSET !EXTRACT NULL
TAG POS=1 TYPE=TD ATTR=STYLE:""background-color: orange;""
TAG POS=R-1 TYPE=* ATTR=* 


'Extract 1st rows
TAG POS=R1 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:descriptorcell
TAG POS=R1 TYPE=A ATTR=CLASS:montagelink EXTRACT=TXT
TAG POS=R1 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:rightcelltd<SP>volcell EXTRACT=TXT
TAG POS=R1 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:rightcelltd<SP>volcell EXTRACT=TXT
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=C:\Users\Desktop FILE=test_{{!NOW:yymmdd_hhnn}}.csv

'Extract 2nd rows
TAG POS=R1 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:descriptorcell
TAG POS=R1 TYPE=A ATTR=CLASS:montagelink EXTRACT=TXT
TAG POS=R1 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:rightcelltd<SP>volcell EXTRACT=TXT
TAG POS=R1 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:rightcelltd<SP>volcell EXTRACT=TXT
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=C:\Users\Desktop FILE=test_{{!NOW:yymmdd_hhnn}}.csv

'Extract 3rd rows
TAG POS=R1 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:descriptorcell
TAG POS=R1 TYPE=A ATTR=CLASS:montagelink EXTRACT=TXT
TAG POS=R1 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:rightcelltd<SP>volcell EXTRACT=TXT
TAG POS=R1 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:rightcelltd<SP>volcell EXTRACT=TXT
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=C:\Users\Desktop FILE=test_{{!NOW:yymmdd_hhnn}}.csv

'Extract 4th rows...
'Extract 5th rows...

Xpath code to extract specific element in nested TR and TD,"Good day everyone. I need guidance to extract a dynamic data from a table with multi-tier nested TR and TD which can be found in tbody section.

Fortunately, my required data can be identified with a unique element style=""background-color: orange;""

I've tried with the followings but resulted with ""EANF"".

1. TAG XPATH=""//*[@id=""opt_montage_table""]/tbody//tr//td[@class='<SP>descriptorcell':[@style='background-color:<SP>orange;]'/div/span/a""] EXTRACT=TXT

2. TAG XPATH=""//*[@id=""opt_montage_table""]/tbody//tr//td[contains(@style,'background-color:<SP>orange;)]'/div/span/a"" EXTRACT=TXT

3. TAG XPATH=""//*[@id=""opt_montage_table""]/tbody/*[contains(@style,'background-color:<SP>orange;)]'/div/span/a"" EXTRACT=TXT

Any advise and guidance will be much appreciated. Thank you.

Download a list of png with a loop,"Hi, I'm a beginner with iMacros and I want to download a list of png with a loop, here is my code :
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=8970419 RECORDER=FX
TAB T=1
SAVEAS TYPE=PNG FOLDER=* FILE=CPPINFO2021
TAG POS=1 TYPE=IMG ATTR=SRC:https://www.doc-solus.fr/lib/images/icones/fleches/fleche.droite.3d.bleu.h100px.jpg


The problem is that at each loop the png gets replaced by a different png with the same name.

So I would want to rename at each loop the png (like CCPINFO2021-0, CCPINFO2021-1, CCPINFO2021-2, ...)

If you have any idea ? Thank you in advance.","

"I need to keep this site ""Open"" all time, please help!","Good day!

I'm working as a Manager in a restaurant. We need to monitor the availability of the restaurant to the customers since some of our employees, are turning it off or making it ""Busy"", even if we don't really have customers. So long story short, Google led me to iMacros, the problem is, my macro is missing something. It can ""Open"" our restaurant, the script is working, but I need it to just ignore if we're already ""Open"", so do not do something else, just ""Open"" if we are ""Busy"". The error is displayed like this:

RuntimeError: element SPAN specified by TXT:reopen was not found, line: 4

I want it to run indefinitely, so when someone sets our restaurant to ""Busy"", the macro will just press ""Reopen"" itself.

Here's what is inside my macro:

Please see the images I attached, and I am hoping that someone will help me with my issue.

Scraping text/links from specific web page <div> section to clipboard?,"[EDITED after feedback - sorry for the long post, trying to input all relevant information...]

I've been working on a project for a couple of years (it's a continual thing, so it's never-ending).
I've progressed to a point of using mouse/keyboard macros to scrape a list of text/links from a set of variable-length pages, to paste into Excel; then run an Excel macro to manipulate that data; then return to the webpage, close it & repeat on the next one (I have some error-checking in place in case of a failure).
I do this every 6 months or so.

I am scraping about *75,000 cemetery index pages on http://www.billiongraves.com, copying the names/dates/links of the people interred there, then sorting, filtering and eventually editing errors & merging duplicate records.
*FYI - there are about 600,000 cemetery pages, but I do some data preparation first, extracting only the 75,000 pages with data on them.

Recently, because of some minor site changes and Firefox add-in customizations, the macros that I painstakingly created over time (to pixel-perfect page coordinates, with JitBit Macro Recorder) need to be shifted & changed, which will take me a week or more to do.  It's painful...

I'm thinking of iMacros as an alternative (or as an additional part of the process), as I would LIKE TO do the following, but am not sure it's capable of this.
A typical page has a particular <div><id> section which shows the data I want - it would be ideal if I could select JUST that <div> section and copy all of its contents at once, to the clipboard, which I can then paste into Excel.
*right now, my macro is scrolling & selecting specifically-positioned lines depending on the length of the list...

So I'm looking for this very basic need first, as I can build up more functionality around it later as I learn more about iMacros.

EXAMPLE PAGE: https://billiongraves.com/site-map?ceme ... 295&page=0 - in the Page Source is the section:
Code: Select all	<div id=""content"">
        <h1 style=""margin: 10px 0 25px 10px;"">BillionGraves Site Map</h1>
        <div class=""card"">
            <h1 style=""float:left; margin: 10px 0 10px 10px;"">Burial records in <a href='/cemetery/Bethesda-Cemetery/100295' >Bethesda Cemetery</a></h1>
            <br class=""clearfloat"" />
            <div style=""border-bottom:#CCC thin solid; width:916px;""> </div>

            <div class=""center"">
*******HERE IS THE DIV ID SECTION 'MULTIPLE' WHICH CONTAINS THE DATA I WANT TO COPY*******                <div id=""multiple"">
                    <div class='backlinks'><a href='/site-map'>Sitemap</a> > <a href='/site-map?country=United+States'>United States</a> > <a href='/site-map?country=United+States&state=Tennessee'>Tennessee</a> > <a href='/cemetery/Bethesda-Cemetery/100295'>Bethesda Cemetery</a></div><div><div class='record'><a href='/grave/William-R-Brooks/31780628' alt='Brooks, William R. (1833 - 1864)' title='Brooks, William R. (1833 - 1864)'>Brooks, William R. (1833 - 1864)</a></div><div class='record'><a href='/grave/Nathan-Andrew-Jackson/31709567' alt='Jackson, Nathan Andrew (1838 - 1864)' title='Jackson, Nathan Andrew (1838 - 1864)'>Jackson, Nathan Andrew (1838 - 1864)</a></div><div class='record'><a href='/grave/Josiah-S-Price/31694361' alt='Price, Josiah S (1838 - 1862)' title='Price, Josiah S (1838 - 1862)'>Price, Josiah S (1838 - 1862)</a></div><div class='record'><a href='/grave/Charles-J-Shropshire/31780629' alt='Shropshire, Charles J.

            </div>
        </div>


My hope is that in selecting 'the entire block' - i.e. the whole <div> section - I can copy all the contents in one shot, rather than having macros scroll to the bottom to capture all the lines, which is not yet working 100% perfectly.

Is iMacros able to select a specific page section (edit: I have found that it can) and copy the hyperlink contents to clipboard or a file?  I see that it can extract content to a CSV file, for example (edit: in the paid version, not the freeware one).  This could work for me (if it creates a 2-column file, with the TEXT and also the LINK - really NEED both!), as I could later combine the CSVs and import to Excel in bulk.
*If the functionality is there to quickly/easily copy a defined <div> section, I'm happy to pay the $99 for the basic version to allow me to SAVEAS a file...

Any help or direction appreciated.

Trying to extract a specific number or character from a body of text rather than the whole line.,"The all important info - 
VERSION BUILD=10101485
OS=macOS Monterey 12.1
Browser=95.0.2 (64-bit)
Other macros functioning as expected=YES

I'd like to my post with an apology, the last time I asked for support I simply gave up but didn't post to say thank you. 

I have been furthering my knowledge of iMacro and it's potential functions playing an online text based games. I'm trying to automate the purchase of a product. I think I've tried a variety of different methods and solutions between extracting css selectors, using the clipboard function and caused myself to become more confused. 
Code: Select allSET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO
URL GOTO=https://awebsite.com/site.php?page=foodhall
' copy required info
TAG POS=2 TYPE=DIV ATTR=TXT:This<SP>foodhall<SP>is<SP>owned<SP>by<SP>Dave<SP>U* EXTRACT=TXT
SET !CLIPBOARD {{!EXTRACT}}
WAIT SECONDS=2
' paste required info
TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=ACTION:https://awebsite.com/site.php?page=foodhall ATTR=NAME:buyfood CONTENT={{!CLIPBOARD}}
WAIT SECONDS=20
' submit
TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:SUBMIT FORM=ACTION:https://awebsite.com/site.php?page=foodhall ATTR=NAME:give
WAIT SECONDS=10

The comment out is for my reference 

The extract function works but I would like some assistance in getting a specific piece of information out of it. 
It returns the following -
This foodhall is owned by Harry's Uncle!
And being held by Harry!
It currently has 220 hams.
The bullet price is $1,000 for each ham!

I would like to extract the 220 in this case (the number changes over time) and paste it into a box below it and submit the form. 

I can provide the html where this information is found if required.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. The forum, program and extensions are fantastic products, I will be purchasing a full license in the near future!","

Extracting from Salesforce webpage,"FCI: Win 7 x32 + FF 49.0.2 (always the latest) + iMacro for FF 9.0.3 (always the latest)

I'm attempting to extract portions of text from a salesforce website and I""m not having any luck figuring out how to accomplish this task.

Here is a snippet of the code from the page that I'm trying to extract data from. ""Member Banks need to journal"" is the text I'm trying to extract. The website is internal to my work domain so a link is not going to be helpful.
Code: Select all</div>
        </td>
        <td class=""efhpCenterContent "">
        <div class=""efhpCenterContentBody"">
            <div class=""efhpCenterTopRow"">
                <span class=""efhpIcon"" style=""background: transparent url(/img/icon/cases16.png) 0 0 no-repeat;""><img title="""" alt="""" src=""/s.gif""/></span>
                <span class=""efhpCenterLabel"">Case Number</span>
                <span class=""efhpCenterValue  ""><span  title=""00056071"">00056071</span></span>
                <span class=""efhpSeparator""> </span>

                <span class=""efhpCenterValue  "">9/20/2016 12:30 PM</span>
            </div>
            <div class=""efhpTitle"" title=""Member Banks need to journal"">Member Banks need to journal</div>


Here is some sample code that I've been playing with but can't seem to work it out.
I've tried inputting all manner of values for CLASS: [with is not present in the code] and for TYPE.

My hope is that once I see how it is done for this value I'll be able to build a iMarco that will Extract all the values I need into a CSV file. I'll also want to extract efhpCenterValue, efhpCenterLabel, and efhpCenterValue, etc.  Those are within a TD and SPAN so I'm not sure if they are handled differently. XPATH may be the way to go, but I'm not sure how to get the XPATH values.

Check if a CSS Selector exists on a webpage,"Hi all,
Preface:
-	I鈥檓 a beginner at coding, so your patience is appreciated   
-	Apologies if this isn鈥檛 the right forum group in which to post this question. I wasn鈥檛 quite sure where to put it.
-	I鈥檝e been looking for the answer to this question for several hours last night and this morning and couldn鈥檛 find it. If this type of question is already answered, I apologize for creating a redundant thread and would appreciate the link.
-	I tried very hard to include all the information required, as mentioned in the 鈥淧lease read this before reporting problems鈥?thread. Please go easy on me if I neglected to include some important information. I鈥檒l happily provide anything else that鈥檚 needed.

iMacros v10.1.0 for FF, 'Free', FF94 (v94.0.1 (64-bit)), Win10_ENG.

I want my script to be able to check to see if there鈥檚 a specific CSS Selector on a webpage. If it doesn鈥檛 exist, I want the script to continue. If it does exist, I want the script to extract the HREF/URL link from the selector, open up a new tab, go to the URL extracted from the selector, and then close the tab and return to the first tab.

The CSS selector in question is:
Code: Select allbody > div:nth-child(15) > a:nth-child(1)

I wrote this code out:
Code: Select allSET !ERRORIGNORE YES
SET !TIMEOUT_STEP 1
TAG SELECTOR=""body > div:nth-child(15) > a:nth-child(1)"" EXTRACT=HREF
TAB OPEN
TAB T=2
URL GOTO={{!EXTRACT}}
WAIT SECONDS=1
TAB CLOSE
SET !EXTRACT NULL
TAB T=1

The problem with this code is that if the selector doesn鈥檛 exist, the script will open a new tab and then freeze (even though I have SET !ERRORIGNORE YES), presumably because it doesn鈥檛 know what to do with !EXTRACT, which is NULL. This is why I need the script to be able to check if the selector is on the page (unless there's another solution of which I'm not aware).

Additionally, I鈥檓 running the free version of iMacros, which only allows for three custom variables. I鈥檓 already using three variables to generate a random number earlier in the script:
Code: Select allSET !VAR1 1
SET !VAR2 3
SET !VAR3 EVAL(""var randomNumber=Math.floor(Math.random()*\""{{!VAR2}}\"" +\""{{!VAR1}}\""); randomNumber;"")

Is it possible to perform the check for the CSS selector without using any variables? If not, is it possible to generate a random number without the three variables so I can then use them for the check?

Thank you for reading and for your help.  ","

My code till line TAG POS=1 TYPE=SELECT ATTR=ID:BaseProductAsTxt61 CONTENT=$*{{!COL8}} works fine.
There are 3 boxes on right hand side with Image name Cigna, ICICI and Edelweiss. The position of these 3 boxes will keep changing every time up and down. Also the number will also change based on the selection.
After line TAG POS=1 TYPE=SELECT ATTR=ID:BaseProductAsTxt61 CONTENT=$*{{!COL8}}  I want to extract that name and amount in same CSV file as mentioned below.

{{!COL11}}  |  {{!COL12}}   |  {{!COL13}}  |  {{!COL14}}  |  {{!COL15}}  |  {{!COL16}} 
CIGNA        |   94162.5      |   ICICI          |  95735         |  Edelweiss   |  99133.2

In {{!COL11}} the name of the top should come and number related to that in {{!COL12}} 
In {{!COL13}} the name of the second should come and number related to that in {{!COL14}} 
In {{!COL15}} the name of the third should come and number related to that in {{!COL16}}

 Also help to loop this code.","

[SOLVED]: Variables in TAG command are not resolved,"Hello everybody,

we need to mark certain values in a checkbox list.

If I record a macro it is giving me lines like
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=HREF:https://www.biconeo-aquascaping.de/mod/shop_admin/?sh_fn=article_edit&sub_fn=set_art_cat&cat_id=36&art_id=2323
TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=HREF:https://www.biconeo-aquascaping.de/mod/shop_admin/?sh_fn=article_edit&sub_fn=set_art_cat&cat_id=39&art_id=2323 
-> This example adds the categories 36 and 39 to the article 2323

We have the article Ids and the category Ids available, so I put them in a CSV file. Connecting to the CSV works, I get different values from the CSV in my script nicely. 

The problem comes with line:
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=HREF:https://www.biconeo-aquascaping.de/mod/shop_admin/?sh_fn=article_edit&sub_fn=set_art_cat&cat_id={{!COL4}}&art_id={!COL5}}
This leads to the error ""Element not found"" where you can see that iMacro doesn't resolve the CSV columns to the desired values. 

I tried 
Code: Select allSET myString https://www.biconeo-aquascaping.de/mod/shop_admin/?sh_fn=article_edit&sub_fn=set_art_cat&cat_id={{!COL4}}&art_id={!COL5}}
TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=HREF:{{myString}} 
This comes to ""Error: ""-1300: ElementNotFound"" at line 28    TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=HREF:{{myString}} Could not find element"", in other words, again the variable is not resolved. 

Can anybody help?

All the best
Casi

Yeah...!, this one approved but the Quality is still as Low as your first 2 Duplicates that I previously disapproved with:
2 Threads disapproved, User Notified, Reason(s):
- 2 Duplicates.
- Thread Title not compliant with Forum Rules.
- User didn't read the Forum Rules...

@User, I was going to approve your 1st Thread and would have asked you to read the Forum Rules to then accordingly improve its ""Quality"", but as you go ""spamming"" the Forum directly without waiting for Approval, I prefer to disapprove them both, ... to give you ""the time"" to read the Forum Rules...

+ Correct Sub-Forum to recreate your Thread would also rather be the 'Data-Extraction' Sub-Forum...


=> But you still reopened your Thread in the 'General' Sub-Forum while I asked you to reopen it in the 'Data-Extraction' Sub-Forum, ah-ah...!    
But OK, no big deal about that part, I will move your Thread myself to the correct Sub-Forum...   
(EDIT: Done, => Thread moved to the 'Data-Extraction' Sub-Forum.)

=> You still didn't read the Forum Rules, which leads to:   
- Thread Title not compliant with the Forum Rules (again!) => Not DESCRIPTIVE, sorry but ""Need help with my Project"" + ""How i resolve this?"" are 2 completely useless Thread Titles for a Tech Forum...   
- CIM...!    (Read my Sig also...   )","

What does this mean? 
Moving forward, Progress will continue to support the iMacros product and will only provide critical fixes as needed until the EOL date.

*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

Thank you for helping us to help you better!","

How can I save all href values from list items to a text file with iMacros?

I am a newbie to imacros but have version 12.0.501.6698 installed on the PC.

I am trying to extract from the html of a page all the href values located in multiple list items. Then save those URLs into a text file.

The number of list items can be different so I cannot use a loop of a known number of iterations; I have to grab all the list items and extract the href attribute values.

Example of the format of the html code
Code: Select all<ul class=""bullet-list columns-2 columns--regular"">
<li><a href=""/search/agents/results.htm?location=ampthill"" >Estate Agents in Ampthill</a></li>
<li><a href=""/search/agents/results.htm?location=barton_le_clay"" >Estate Agents in Barton-Le-Clay</a></li>
<li><a href=""/search/agents/results.htm?location=bedford"" >Estate Agents in Bedford</a></li>
<li><a href=""/search/agents/results.htm?location=biggleswade"" >Estate Agents in Biggleswade</a></li>
<li><a href=""/search/agents/results.htm?location=bromham"" >Estate Agents in Bromham</a></li>
<li><a href=""/search/agents/results.htm?location=clapham_beds"" >Estate Agents in Clapham</a></li>
</ul>

I have looked at the code in similar articles such as - iMacros: Extract ID attribute from a ul li list

This is the code I have tried in imacros.
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=12.0.501.6698
TAB T=1
SET !ERRORIGNORE YES
SET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO
TAB CLOSEALLOTHERS
'SET !PLAYBACKDELAY 0.00
URL GOTO=https://www.home.co.uk/search/agents/?county=beds

TAG POS=1 TYPE=UL ATTR=ID:bullet-list EXTRACT=LI
TAG POS=R{{!LOOP}} TYPE=A ATTR=ID:* EXTRACT=HREF
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=* FILE=c:\Development\towns.txt

I get an error Box

enter image description here

I have also tried modifying all the permutations for the Values of TYPE and what to EXTRACT.

The text file that should store the URLs from the href attributes in this line:

<li><a href=""/search/agents/results.htm?location=clapham_beds"" >Estate Agents in Clapham</a></li>

just contains a line #EANF# not ""/search/agents/results.htm?location=clapham_beds""

my imacros script does all these things, but most of the time if freezes.  There is something, (i believe) in the webpage that trys to prevent automation.

Problem with selecting a checkbox next to target text (text has no HTML tags),"Good evening everyone!

I can't solve a problem with iMacros and it is really bugging me, so I would really appreciate if someone could help me. I hope I've opened the topic on the correct board; otherwise, please forgive me, for this is my first post.
I spent hours and hours going through the wiki and this forum, but I cannot reach my goal of selecting checkboxes with the target text next to them on a specific website. So I'm starting to wonder if it's the problem of the HTML code, or if I'm doing something entirely wrong. I will describe the details below.

1. Config Info: 

iMacros for Firefox plugin 8.9.7, free (VERSION BUILD=8970419); browser: Pale Moon 28.9.3; OS: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit English

2. Target site code: 

The text content were replaced with general English terms because they were originally in Hungarian. (Also, ""etc etc"" was written by me in the STYLE section because it was a rather long style section with no real impact on my issue/macro itself.)  
Code: Select all<DIV id=""cuccLayer"" STYLE=""position:absolute; font-weight:bold; (etc etc...); "">
		 <center>Title1</center>
		 <hr>

<input type=""checkbox"" onClick=""cuccArray[0]=1-cuccArray[0];""> 410 pcs. ITEM1<br><input type=""checkbox"" onClick=""cuccArray[1]=1-cuccArray[1];""> 27 pcs. ITEM2<br><input type=""checkbox"" onClick=""cuccArray[2]=1-cuccArray[2];""> 9 pcs. ITEM3<br><input type=""checkbox"" onClick=""cuccArray[3]=1-cuccArray[3];""> 1 pc. ITEM4<br><input type=""checkbox"" onClick=""cuccArray[4]=1-cuccArray[4];""> 89 pcs. ITEM5<br><input type=""checkbox"" onClick=""cuccArray[5]=1-cuccArray[5];""> 23 pcs. ITEM6<br>
		 <hr>
		 <center>
		 <input type=""image"" src="".../SUBMIT.gif"" title=""SUBMIT"" onClick=""document.urlap.par1.value=cuccArrayToString(); document.urlap.Submit.value='svSelejtezes'; document.urlap.submit();"">
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		 <input type=""image"" src="".../sample2.gif"" width=""35"" height=""35"" title=""Title2"" onClick=""cuccHide(); return false;"">
		 </center>
</DIV>

3. Problem: 

I'm trying to write a macro that will look for specific text(s) on a site and then select the checkbox on the left side of it. For example, let's say I want to select the checkboxes to the left of the texts ""pcs.<SP>ITEM3"", ""pcs.<SP>ITEM4"" and ""pcs.<SP>ITEM5"". 

However, the checkboxes and the text are in a shared DIV container called ""cuccLayer"" and the texts don't have their own HTML tags and because of that, I fail to use relative positioning, even though I went over a lot of chivracq's posts dealing with the topic. I simply cannot come up with a solution, because all the macros I wrote (even after tweaking with POS=R1,R-1, etc) seem to handle all the text as a whole (verified by extraction in test mode) and I cannot position the checkboxes. My last idea before giving up and posting here was using relative positioning with the <br>tag, with no success (maybe TAG cannot be used with empty tags lacking an end tag, or simply <br> is not recognized?) 

The position/order of the checkboxes + texts are not static but PHP/JS-related, so the checkbox must be selected based on the current text following it (for more info, see: end of section 4).

4. Context, additional info about the target site and my macro: 

A sudden wave of nostalgia hit me, and I started to play again with a 19 year old Hungarian browser-based online RPG which I really enjoyed as a teen. Currently, I'm progressing with the quests. However, because only a few die-hard fans play the game anymore, making money is quite difficult because of a lack of ingame economy, so the only solution left is ""farming"" gold (meaning doing repetitive tasks to get items that I can sell in the game's own shop itself so I can generate gold without the need to trade with other players on the ingame marketplace).

I already succesfully wrote several ""farming"" macros that combine both JavaScript and iMacros (this is the main reason I'm using an older build with Pale Moon, due to the need for JS support). This means that the macro automates an ingame activity called mining, and my player character automatically mines ores with various value to sell. However, after a while, my inventory overflows with heavy and cheap ores, taking up much space from the ligher and more expensive ones, such as diamonds etc. When this occurs, a new interface comes in, telling me that I'm carrying too much stuff and I need to throw away something (this currently requires manual intervention on my part, meaning my macro is not fully automated). My target code provided in section 2 is this problematic interface which lists all the amount (""x pcs.""), and items (""ITEM3, ITEM4 and ITEM5"") in my bag and ask me to select with the checkbox what I want to throw away with a submit form. ""ITEM3, ITEM4 and ITEM5"" are the heavy and cheap stuff I want to automatically dispose of, so my macro can run in a loop and keep only the expensive items.

Also, because this is a PHP/JS-based online game, the array of items in my inventory are generated by the game and therefore dynamic, so I guess the onClick=""cuccArray[x]=1-cuccArray[x]; attribute of the checkbox I want to select cannot really be predicted/automated, because if the items in my inventory change, the array can be numbered completely differently.

5. Closing thoughts

I deliberately chose not to include any of my macros I experimented with, because I tried so many combinations that I wouldn't even know which one to write here. So if this seems as lazy to anyone, please forgive me. Thank you for everyone who went through my post, I would really appreciate some help. Even if my goal cannot be achieved because of the HTML structure, I would like to know it, because otherwise I will keep trying and failing. It might have started out as silly nostalgia but now the idea of me not being to solve the macro is bugging me even more than my love for that old browser RPG. I also really hope that the solution is not something really easy because I would feel very dumb (as I've mentioned, I've already succesfully did scripts and macros for other parts of this game, so I can use iMacros on at least a basic level).","

TAG POS=R1 gives the wrong result. Why?,"I USE IMACROS V12.5.503 BROWSER AND WIN 10 PRO X64

I tried to write a code that if see this number""0.000000000000000""(in doge box), the macro give me -1310 error but According to the photo, at present the number inside the Dodge Box is not equal to the searched number(TXT:""0.000000000000000"").
but macro gives me an error code -1310. i use EXTRACT:TXT instead of CONTENT=EVENT:FAIL_IF_FOUND to find that element and I found that it returns the number 0.000000000000000, which is inside the next box. Why?
If I remove TXT:""0.000000000000000"" from the second line of code, the second line of code points to the number inside the Dodge box, and if I return it, it points to the number inside the next box!!!!!!

extract text from Element with non-fixed location,"hi 
i use imacros browser 12.5 and windows 10 pro x64

i want to extract some text from a website
Description of text and square:
Every time I enter the site, the location of each square (only the squares, not the text inside them), which includes reinvest, withtraw, etc., changes.
The square location changes every time I enter the site and I can not extract the text correctly. I want to extract the number inside the square corresponding to doge. Inside the attached photo, it is written 0.825348080509353. This number is constantly increasing.
I used the Extraction Wizard feature and got the following code. (Click on number)
Code: Select allTAG POS=2 TYPE=H4 ATTR=CLASS:cloud-percent EXTRACT=TXT
This code works fine. As long as the location does not change.
But when its location changes and xmr, for example, takes its place, the number corresponding to xmr (returns 0.00000000000000)
I even tried to select the doge text as an anchor title so that
Code: Select allTAG POS=2 TYPE=H4 ATTR=CLASS:m-2 EXTRACT=TXT
Again, this code works as long as the location does not change
i update this code as following but get not found error
Code: Select allTAG POS=2 TYPE=H4 ATTR=CLASS:m-2&&TXT:DOGE EXTRACT=TXT
and this is the doge text html tag
Code: Select all<h4 class=""m-2"">DOGE</h4>
What is the solution now?
I hope the explanation is complete.","

Extracting text with asterisk,"1. What version of iMacros are you using?

Windows 10, English

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Firefox 85.0

I'm trying to locate text on the page that includes a literal asterisk using the TAG command. I've tried several different methods for escaping it, but can't find anything that works. Any advice?

The most relevant post I could find was this viewtopic.php?f=7&t=9779&p=29270&hilit=asterisk#p29270 but it's nearly 11 years old and I'm hoping the answer is different now.

My goal on this page is to find these entries, click an edit button, remove the asterisk, and save the change.","

How to extract nested informations using XPATH?,"iMacros ver: 10.0.2.1450 (FREE), Firefox, Windows 10

Hello,
The objective is to extract the value of HTML DOM Property such as id,href and data-download-file-url for each of the images displayed from this [website][https://www.freepik.com/search?dates=an ... rt=popular]. I believe XPATH will be suitable for this task as each of the image can be accessed by the following generalise XPATH Code: Select all/html/body/main/section[2]/div/div/figure[X]/div

with the capital X indicate the Image label that take the value from 1 to 50, for the aforementioned website.

I know that, to extract the properties of Figure 1, for example, can be achieved by
Code: Select allTAG XPATH=""/html/body/main/section[2]/div/div/figure[1]""  EXTRACT=TXT

However, the line above outputted all DOM Property including the one that I am not interested with.

According to the tutorial  below;

[OP1][https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?t=26155]
[OP2][https://stackoverflow.com/questions/385 ... cros-xpath]

Extracting specific DOM property can be achieved by something like the following
Code: Select allTAG XPATH=""/html/body/main/section[2]/div/div/figure[1]/div[@id='showcase__content'] ""  EXTRACT=TXT

However, the execution instead give an error.

I really appreciate if someone can shed some light about this problem.","

Exit script if account not found and move to next,"Greetings,

I have a VB script that runs an ""open account"" imacro that pulls up accounts in a web portal and then runs another imacro script to extract various fields. It works well enough but the problem is, if the account in question is not found, it continues to run the extract script. What I would like it to do is abort/exit if the account can not be pulled up and continue to the next account while entering ""not found"" beside the offending entry. Thank you!

My setup details are: 

Microsoft Windows 10 Home

"How to grab variable in source code to extract? (script type=""text/javascript""> var abc = <payload>)","Hi there,

first off, let me include some information:
VERSION BUILD=12.6.505.4525, Trial Version on Windows 10 64-bit, English with Browser IE11. Demo scripts and another script that I built today work well.

I am trying to build a macro that will run through a series of weekends for a car rental company and will store the advertised price in a csv file. I will then later be able to look at the data, mark which weekends I find interesting and - that will be a future project - use a second macro to book those weekends.

The company's website is nice enough to include all the data I really want in one ""object"" up top. ""Object"", because here is where it gets tricky for me: I don't know how to call that, let alone grab it. It is not something that drives the display on the website, and I can't seem to use the right ""find"" option for the TAG command - however I wonder whether it would not be much more elegant go via xpath, if that is possible here.

How would I go about 
1) for beginners, and to understand how this works, grabbing everything inside the variable sxux?
2) to really get what I need, grabbing the part marked in green, i.e. the entire string in quotation marks right after ""prc_wc"" (our, put differently everything between prc_wc and prc_pp)?






Below is the code of the snippet I am trying to get.
Code: Select all<script type=""text/javascript"">

Calculation of extracted values,"Hi i found this topic [url]viewtopic.php?f=7&t=29657[/url ]interesting and try to figure out a calucalation based macro myself.

I am using VERSION BUILD=10021450 in FF

Using the free version currently 

Currently my code is following:

TAB T=2  
'URL GOTO=http://demo.imacros.net/Automate/AutoDataEntry
TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=ID:demo ATTR=ID:fname CONTENT={{!VAR1}}

What i am trying to reach is get the price of an item in step one and add  +5% via the EVAL command to the price before i paste it into another field.
However something seems to be wrong with my code. It just extracts the price and does not modify nor paste it into the field. I made sure it only extracts numbers (Format: XX,XXX) and nothing else.
Any idea on this?

In another step i would also like to divide the price through a fixed number. Example would be to calculate how many items i can purchase for a fixed amount i have in my wallet. Would this worK?

What i want to achieve, is to fill out a webform based on data i have locally saved on my harddrive. The data is somewhere in the Excel file so i cannot use the loop model where it seemingly just flies through the document and prints everyhting into a webform. What i need is instructions how to define and extract content from a specific line / column combination and put it into a specific field of the webform.

Can anybody help me with the code for this?","

Trying to redo loop if EANF,"Hi guys, first post,  trying to self teach iim and its going pretty well but i need to redo some of my web scraping and im a bit stumped.   Heres the raw code,  I use it to enter 2 variables and then press go and i want to scrape the output  The issue is My internet is rotating Ip every so often and if it times up just right when it rotates then the output is EANF,  for some reason if i get too many of those then iim just locks up and it doesn't work anymore,  I like to set this up to run all night and set it to run slow so it never messes up.  I think what i need to do though is something along the lines of

If Extract = #EANF# then redo this loop using same variables

SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=C:\Users\hirea\Downloads FILE=Output.csv

Is it possible to Search and Replace Text on Website?,"Some websites have text fields where I can edit the text. Is it possible for iMacros to search and replace text in the text field?

Any ideas?

p.s. The website where I would actually like to replace the text is much more complicated. I will create a dummy account and provide login credentials if someone is willing to help. Maybe start with the simpler example above though..?

Selecting a specific range of my pinterest followers to follow back,"Imacros Paid Personal Edition Version 10.0.2.1450 Last Updated June 20, 2020
Firefox 77.0.1 (64-bit)
Windows 10 (64-bit)
All demo macros work fine


I have tried relentlessly over the past week to adjust my script so it only scrapes followers that themselves have at least a certain amount of followers. One of my accounts get spammed persistent and I simply need to filter out the noise from real meaningful followers

The following script does in fact work quite well down only to one problem, the loop. It runs fine all the way to the extract tag position and than instead of grabbing the actual tag of the current loop it somehow takes the next one instead. I even utilized the great idea about the loop-switch posted in the forum to jump out if a condition is not met

What it currently does is to filter out all my followers that have themselves at least 400+ followers and writes it into the csv file. Perhaps CONTENT=MOUSEOVER is wrong but I am not sure.

PROBLEM 1: the first TAG POS is working correctly, however further down the TAG POS should still be in the same LOOP iteration but it is not, it is taking the next found TAG instead.

PROBLEM 2: SAVEAS EXTRACT does not write the extract each into a new line inside the csv file but simply all into one line.

I would greatly appreciate some help to hopefully get it solved as I am out of ideas on this one. Thank you

SOF: Extract Data using EVAL with Triple Separator.,"Some interesting Thread on SOF from 2 weeks ago, the User was ""supposed"" to open a parallel Thread on our Forum, but after asking several times and ""waiting"" with no Follow-up anymore since 10 days, I guess they probably managed to find a Solution, that they probably will never share, so I'm a bit ""tired"" of waiting and I'm creating this ""parallel"" Thread ""on their behalf""..., before they will eventually delete their Thread on SOF, which happens for more than 50% of Threads/Qt's related to iMacros on that Forum...

Question answered: 180 question was answered among 200

what I want

for customer review and question answered I want only first number: 666 & 180 not text or any other number

and for product title: The text part before first comma (,): PLUSINNO Telescopic Fishing Rod and Reel Combos Full Kit it can be either , or : or - so the product title will be cut off by first (, or : or -)

I know eval can help, but I can not implement.

Thank you.

... And I would of course have been ""curious"" to hear how this User implemented the desired Functionality to extract this ""Product title"" Field until the first of the 3 possible Separators, a bit like the Functionality in 'Excel' when importing/opening a '.CSV' File, with 5 or 6 possible Separators that can be combined together...

I had several possible Solutions/Implementations in mind, but I think if I had had to implement that Functionality for myself, I would have gone for 'indexOf()' for the 3 Separators, + 'push()' to an Array with a Check on 'indexOf()'>=0 (Char/String not found returns ""-1""), and then with 'Math.min()' or 'sort()' on the Array to return the lowest 'indexOf()' Value (>0) to reuse with 'substr()' or 'substring()' on the original Extract...   

And hum, with ""only"" 3 Separators, it might actually be simpler and shorter to handle all the Conditions with just several 'if'/'else' Statements...  ","

I am using above code to extract google search result as csv format. The code has no issue. Problem is after running the loops 7 times or generally 13 times or any random times captcha comes (I am not robot) and I need pause the loop to solve captcha manually. I am expecting to implement captcha solution in my code so each time captcha comes imacros solve it automatically and the the code runs without interrupt . As you can see I am using csv file as input to run google search which contain 2000+ rows so I can not sit and solve captcha manually.

I have search for solution in this forum and got info that may be I have to buy a captcha solution service but do not know how it will work with  my current iim file as the captcha comes suddenly rather than the site which contains a form with I am a robot captcha always there.

Thank You

Help needed with Keyword Assertion,"VERSION BUILD=10022823
iMacros 10 Browser
Windows 10

First of all, apologies for my naivety in this subject. I'm still pretty new to all this.
Basically I'm looking to write a code that goes to a user on a website, and if it finds the words 'Status: Online' it saves the username to an online.txt file, and if the username is offline it saves it to a offline.txt file, and then moves on to the next username, which would be given by {{!COL2}}.
Now I understand that the macro is searching for Status: Online or Status: Offline, but then the extract command is mutually exclusive regardless of whether or not it finds the text on the page anyway.
Thus when I run the script, it saves the username to both the Online file, and the Offline file.
Here's what I have so far:
Code: Select allSET !DATASOURCE filter.csv
SET !LOOP 1
SET !DATASOURCE_LINE {{!LOOP}}
FILTER TYPE=IMAGES STATUS=ON

URL GOTO=www.test.com/user={{!COL1}}
 
SEARCH SOURCE=TXT:""Status: Online""
'TAG POS=9 is the location of the username
TAG POS=9 TYPE=FONT ATTR=* EXTRACT=TXT

SET !CLIPBOARD {{!EXTRACT}}
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=""my filepath"" FILE=Online.txt
SET !EXTRACT NULL

SEARCH SOURCE=TXT:""Status: Offline""
'TAG POS=9 is the location of the username
TAG POS=9 TYPE=FONT ATTR=* EXTRACT=TXT

SET !CLIPBOARD {{!EXTRACT}}
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=""C:\\Users\\cooki\\Desktop\\Users Online"" FILE=Offline.txt
SET !EXTRACT NULL

Any help to get me on the right path would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!","

Triggering macro to accept or reject jobs (text lines with links) when they appear,"VERSION BUILD=12.0.501.6698
Microsoft Windows 10
IE 11 or Firefox 74.0

Hello, I'm working in remote as a contractor for a customer who has CST, while I have Greenwich time (a little different actually, but it's not important). I would like to activate a macro able to accept or reject new jobs when they pop up on the customer's website while I'm sleeping. I've already recorded macros to accept or reject jobs when they appear. A new job displays as a simple line of text on top of the screen, then I can run a macro like:

TAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=ID:cphMain_gvwWorkOrderList_Label1_0
TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:SUBMIT FORM=ID:form1 ATTR=ID:cphMain_btnAccept (Firefox)

TAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=ID:cphMain_gvwWorkOrderList_Label1_0
TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:SUBMIT ATTR=NAME:ctl00$cphMain$btnAccept (IE)

What I need is something that triggers this only when a new job appears in the main window (accepted jobs remain there, only in a different color, like rows of a table, so they must not trigger the macro).","

*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

Thank you for helping us to help you better!","

imacros question
Posted by Focalav 禄 27/02/2020 - 18:46

HI all Im trying to do a data extract from a specific loaction, for a random bit of data using imacros.
Im trying to use a SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP query but the query structure is a mystery to me.
Ive read: http://wiki.imacros.net/SEARCH
but this doesn't explain enough so that I can figure out how to make it useful in building my own query.

A sample bit of the source webpage is:
Code: Select all<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=""220px""><div style=""width:200; height:25; background:url(/images/timedcombat-background.png); border:1px solid #000000;""></div></td><td>Next target: <b>6 seconds</b></i></td></tr></table>

So Ive tried: a whole bunch of stuff trying to figure out how the query structure works but I haven't go it.

Imacros Notes on using SEARCH REGEXP
Code: Select allSEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:..[^]"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: undefined
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:..[^s]"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: undefined
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:..[^0-9]"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: undefined
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:"".*target..([0-9]+)"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: Source Doesnt match target
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target..([0-9]+)"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: Source Doesnt match target
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:..([0-9]+)"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives:Source Doesnt match target
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:..([^0-9]+)"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives:Source Doesnt match target
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:..([^0-9])"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: b
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:.([^0-9])"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: <
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:([^0-9])"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: Blank, literaly, the space character I think..
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:?([^0-9])"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: ;
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:?.([^0-9])"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: <
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:?.([^0-9])"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: Blank, literaly, the space character I think..
Code: Select allSEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:?.([^0-9]+)"" EXTRACT=$1
... =>  | gives: UGH,.. some part of the Imacros source code?
Code: Select allvar altKey;
var ctrlKey;
var metaKey;
if (window.event != null) {
c=String.fromCharCode(window.event.keyCode).toUpperCase();
altKey=window.event.altKey;
ctrlKey=window.event.ctrlKey;
metaKey=window.event.metaKey;
}else{
c=String.fromCharCode(e.charCode).toUpperCase();
altKey=e.altKey;
ctrlKey=e.ctrlKey;
metaKey=e.metaKey;
}
if (window.event != null)
target=window.event.srcElement;
else
target=e.originalTarget;
if (target.nodeName.toUpperCase()=='INPUT' || target.nodeName.toUpperCase()=='TEXTAREA' || altKey || ctrlKey || metaKey){
}else{
if (c == '

So Then I decided I need help. Yes, I'm on the imacros forums, but help there is hit and miss.
is there documentation of how exactly to form Search Source queries using imacros? Or does anyone use Imacros, and could explain this to me.

So, here it is...   
I won't ""try"" to answer it (even if there are some much easier/simpler Solutions) as the User didn't ""follow up"" on my Disapproval by reopening their Thread with some ""correct"" Quality, but I found the Research part with all different 'SEARCH' Statements and their Results quite interesting though   , and worth sharing on the Forum...   

And I've reformatted a bit the Post, especially about the very last 'SEARCH' Statement that I separated from the previous ones, which seems to retrieve some iMacros Core Code about the 'EVENT' Mode... Hum..., strange indeed...   

>>>

@OP (= @Focalav), you are still ""welcome"" to post in this Thread if you ""notice"" it, you won't be able to take Ownership of this Thread, but if you post in it, you'll be able to get Notifications..., and I might still help you if you follow up ""a bit correctly"" and also mention your FCI like I already asked you...   
(But don't try to create your own Thread now (about the same Qt), that would be a Duplicate, and I wouldn't approve it anyway, you had 1 week already to do so, now it's too late, sorry...   )","

How to extract certain links and assign them to an array variable?,"Hi. I am new to iMacros.

 I use Windows 10, iMacros 12.0.1.171 Enterprise trial version, chrome 78.0.x

 Any help will be greatly appreciated!

 I want to do something very simple but don't know how to do this.


 I want to extract all the links having a certain word in a web page.

 For example, I want to extract all the links having 'JCC' like below:

  1) http://JCC.domain-name.com/any_number_or_letter_or_whatever
  2) http://JCC.domain-name.com/any_number_or_letter_or_whatever
  3) http://JCC.domain-name.com/any_number_or_letter_or_whatever

  ... and so on

 After extracting all the links above, I want to move to each web page one by one or randomly.

 I mean, after visiting the first page, I want do something, and then, I want to move to the 2nd web page,  and then wait for 7 seconds, using 'WAIT SECONDS=7' command, to load the web page completely, and I want to do something... and so on.

I must not visit the web page I had already paid a visit.

 Q1) How can I assign each link having a certain word to an array? How can I assign all the links to an array AT RANDOM or FROM TOP-TO-BOTTOM OF THE HTML PAGE?

 Q2) How can I move to each web page using the array variable?

 Sometimes, the web page doesn't show all the links having 'JCC's, so I might have to hit the F5 key to refresh the web page.

 Sometimes I get no new link, sometimes 5 or 10 new links which were not displayed before reloading the web page. 

 There is no way to know how many times I have to reload the web page but I guess 2 to 5 would be good.

 Q3) I want to add all the new links from the reloaded the web page to the previous array. How can I do this?


[Q4] I might have to use this macro later again. Then, I must NOT revisit the web page I'd already visited. How can I make iMacros do this?

 Thank you very much in advance. : )","

Issues with EXTRACT (Using Xero software),"1. What version of iMacros are you using?

Hi all,

Hoping you can help. VERY new to this iMacros so forgive my ignorance. I am trying to run a loop of updating bills on the Xero accounting software and have hit an issue with copy/paste text using EXTRACT function. My code (or portion of it ) is below;
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=ID:addNewLineItemButton
TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=ID:ext-gen60
TAG POS=1 TYPE=IMG ATTR=ID:ext-gen63

TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=ID:frmMain ATTR=ID:ext-comp-1005 CONTENT={{!VAR2}}
SET !EXTRACT NULL#

I am having an issue specifially with the line
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT


When I prompt to see what !VAR2 is, the returned text string is almost like it has done a crtl-A of the whole webpage. Am I doing something obviously wrong? Does Xero have stange things imbedded into their text strings that is messing me around? 

In short, I am trying to copy one cell of data to another. It is always a number string. Never text.

Thanks for your help","

Playback Not Working,"Hello,

I have an issue where the macro seems to have recording with no issues but when I play it back the page does seem to recognize that the information was entered. As a result there is nothing to extract and so it fails.

I am using iMacros 11.5.4498.2403

The browser is in iMacros. Not sure if it uses Chrome or IE or what.

All other macros I have created work with no issues.

That is the macro that I recorded with no issues but when I replay it the error on the screen says that the reference number I entered.. 714234 isn't there and therefor the following page doesn't open for the extract portion to run.

Please let me know if there is any more information I can provide.

iMacros 12 not recording keystrokes or extracting data,"I鈥檓 creating a Excel macro with iMacros and VBA.  I've done this before without too many issues on a number of web sites.  I started off using the iMacros browser.  I got about 1/2 way through entering data on the web page without any issues.  So far so good.

This particular web page has a number of sections, e.g., Summary Info, Claim Info, Parts, Operations, Expenses, Comments, and Customer (in this order).  When I got to the Parts, Operations, Expenses, Comments, and Customer sections, there is a toggle switch to hide / display the fields in that section.  The Parts, Operations, and Expenses sections all display a minus sign (to hide the fields) but no fields are displayed.  The Comments and Customer fields also display the minus sign but the fields in those sections are displayed.  I haven't seen anything like that before.

I then changed the code to use iMacros with the IE browser.  The good news is I can now see the missing fields in all of the sections now.  I kicked off the macro and it got part way through the existing code and then I had an issue where it didn't extract the header I was looking for.  I tried to use the sidebar but can鈥檛 use IMacros functionality, e.g., it won鈥檛 let me extract data and doesn鈥檛 record keystrokes like I normally can.  It's almost like it is frozen.  

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated...鈥︹€︹€?.shaves

Make an IF statement with EVAL command,"Hello Everyone   

I'm using 
Code: Select alliMacros v9.0.3 on Firefox 53.0.3 (64 bit) in Windows 10 x64

I'm trying to create a script that I will use it in LOOP mode, extracting pictures from a website. Until here everything is great.

I just want to setup an If statement; 

IF the value of !VAR1 is a multiple of one hundred, which means (VAR1=100) or (VAR1=200) or (VAR1=300) ... or (VAR1=6600)

THEN run this command 
Code: Select allADD !VAR4 1
ELSE ignore and continue


I think it's possible to do it with EVAL command  , I tried several hours but no result.    

Thank you","

Extracting data with Chrome addon,"I'm trying to learn more about the Chrome addon in hopes that it may solve some issues I have with pop-ups.  I'm able to open iMacros in Chrome.  My issue is I don't seem to be able to extract data with the Chrome addon.  If I use the IM or IE browser, there are buttons to extract data.  Easy.  However, when I try to use the Chrome addon, I can record a macro and it works.  However, I don't see any buttons to extract data.  Am I missing something?  Is it right in front of me?

Also, macros seem to run slower with the Chrome addon than with IM or IE browser but that's a question for another day.  

Any help in extracting data would be appreciated.  If there is reference material that you can point me to that would be helpful.  I've tried the Wiki and haven't found what I'm looking for.  I'm not sure what the purpose of the Chrome addon is at this point.  Thanks for your help.

Extracting users in instagram (in the likes of the photo),"Hi everybody! i am new on imacros scripting and i am not a programmer. I know very little about programming and I only adapt the command lines and analyze how they work, so I am making the program work.

I managed to learn about imacros at this time but still I need to explain step by step all detailed how to run the following program.

I make a video explain the problem.
Please look at the cursor carefully and interpret how it works, it's simple

https://youtu.be/tMbF3CawzRU


My goal is as follows: Open the profile of a user, select a photo and enter the ""Like"", within the ""I like"" enter the profile of each person to extract the username ""URL"".

The problem is that my program only extracts 11 users (Those that appear as ""DIV"" in the instagram code).

I designed another program which appears at the beginning of the video to demonstrate how it extracts perfectly but this is ONLY for FOLLOWERS - FOLLOWED.
Analyze the instagram code and this code allows me to ""preload"" the number of people I need and this makes the program WORK. Unlike the previous one (within the ""LIKES"" IT DOES NOT ALLOW ME ""PRE LOAD"" USERS and this limits the program (LOOP = 12-15-20-30-etc. It stops working with error # EANF #).

First program ( VIDEO ) code: ""FOLLOWES AND FOLLOWED (ONLY) ""
Code: Select allSET !ERRORIGNORE YES
SET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO
SET !TIMEOUT_STEP 1

TAG POS={{!LOOP}} TYPE=A ATTR=CLASS:FPmhX<SP>notranslate<SP>_0imsa EXTRACT=HREF


SET !VAR1 {{!EXTRACT}}
SET !EXTRACT NULL

'Check EXTRACT
TAB OPEN
TAB T=2

Code: Select allSET !ERRORIGNORE YES

I don't think they need anything more than this.
I am looking to extract the number of users that I need (20-30-50 users within the likes of the photo)
Apparently the DIV structure does not allow pre-loading users and I don't know how to solve this in order to extract the number of users that I want

possible to scrape/save images using imacros and save to csv?,"Hi - is it possible for an imacros script to scrape/copy/save an image from a website and place it into a spreadsheet (xlsx or csv)? Ideally I want imacros to take the image from the site, then reduce the size so it fits into a column field in a spreadsheet. For instance if the website image is 10cm x 10cm large, reduce the size to 2cm x 2cm and insert into the spreadsheet. Is this possible and if so how? many thanks","

Extracting Data with Regex & Fill In The Value Using VAR,"I have been trying for quite some hours now, couldn't get this regex work.

It works on regex101.com for I just want to extract price from a html source page.
Code: Select all<td class=""next-table-cell"" style=""text-align: left;"">
<div class=""next-table-cell-wrapper"">
<div class=""myinput-wrap"">
<span class=""next-input next-input-single next-input-medium  "" style=""width: 100%;"">
<input type=""text"" min=""0"" placeholder=""<=[b][u]15.9[/u][/b]"" value="""" height=""100%"">
</span>

<td class=""next-table-cell"" style=""text-align: left;"">
<div class=""next-table-cell-wrapper"">
<div class=""myinput-wrap"">
<span class=""next-input next-input-single next-input-medium  "" style=""width: 100%;"">
<input type=""text"" min=""0"" placeholder=""<=[b][u]19.93[/u][/b]"" value="""" height=""100%"">
</span>

I want first, to extract all these value(multiple outcome) into a .txt file

Then use SET !LOOP or VAR to these enter values into boxes on the same webpage.

I want to extract 19.93 from this line,
Code: Select all<input type=""text"" min=""0"" placeholder=""<=[b][u]19.93[/u][/b]"" value="""" height=""100%"">

I use
Code: Select all\=(\d+\.\d{1,2})

I tried these and it doesn't work,
Code: Select allSEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:\=(\d+\.\d{1,2})""    EXTRACT=$1
Code: Select allSEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""\=(\d+\.\d{1,2})""    EXTRACT=$1

Not showing any result even with [Undefined]
Code: Select allSEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""1""    EXTRACT=$1
Code: Select allSEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""a""    EXTRACT=$1
Code: Select allSEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""*""    EXTRACT=$1 

Can anyone shed a light, is regexp no longer supported?

Anyway, I downgraded to 9.0.3.

I think I will also try another way, save the page source and use CMD to filter out the result.

Thank you.","

How to or the best way to get the product images and a way of attaching them, referring to them or saving them to the csv file from the extracted text?

I need to be able to get all the product data with images on all the pages.  I can figure out how to get info on one product but not all.  I can figure out how to get one image but not all and how would I capture the images and refer them to the part number text capture in the csv file?

Scrape with smart XPath,"Usually i scrape with a tool, which understands ""smart"" XPath - means, if i set scraper to scrape XPath Code: Select all//div[@class='example-class'], so i get content from all occurences of this class. I really need this, because the site i scrape has different amount of this class occurences - from zero to 10.

If i use this kind of expression with iMacros, i get only the first occurence of this class. How should i setup Xpath in iMacros to get all occurences of the class, independently of the amount?","

I have two issues with the downloaded data.
1.  The data is going into the wrong file.  The data from the first page is going into the file with suffix KZ and the data from the second page is going into the file with the suffix AJ.  I could simply rename the files but I don't think I should have to.
2.  The first column has the data duplicated in the same column: ie ""ABC"" comes through as ""ABCABC"".  Again I could handle that in programming but I don't think I should have to.

Thanx for any help and guidance.","

How to use TAG SELECTOR for extracting a table,"Hi,
Using IMacros Personal Edition 12.5 with Firefox
I  have a little trouble with extracting data from a table. So I decided that I would try using a CSS selector (TAG SELECTOR=""""). But I cant find any examples of using TAG in this manner.

This is my TAG command  (Editor tells me: Syntax Error):
Code: Select allTAG SELECTOR="".darker-grey-header-background , .asc , .align-top , .navigateable , .align-center , .thick-top-header-border"" EXTRACT=TXT

I generated the CSS selector using a tool: SelectorGadget (Addon for Chrome). I assume that the CSS selector for FireFox would be the same as in Chrome.

My Question: Is this the correct way for using TAG SELECTOR?
Thanks.","

Good application this IMacro!
I was so far able to get most of what I needed to automate but I am stuck for this one. 

I need to extract the Meta name tags in the headers web page: Description, keyword, location...ETC.

Here is an example of the tags in the header:
Code: Select all<meta name=""Description"" content=""Description I would like to extract"">
<meta name=""Keywords"" content=""Keywords I would like to extract"">


I have tried several ways, but none worked so far. I got wrong format for the tag or the ""#EANF#"" error code on any of the trials I did.

I did look on the Forum and found some related posts, but no solutions were given, even if possible.

iMacros for IE stops scraping data after 15-20 minutes while script runs,"I've been having an ongoing issue with iMacros for IE where, while running a script, the script will run fine for about 15-20 minutes (grabbing the data I need), but then stops grabbing the data and fills empty. I've tried time constraints to give the page enough time to upload, but this is not the issue.
I've isolated this problem to only IE, as it runs fine on Firefox (and even ran fine on the iMacros browser, which I no longer have). The only issue is, I need to run this script in IE (as it captures the data in such a way that makes it usable for me).

Is anyone else having this issue, and have they found a way around it?","

Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=12.0.501.6698

The case is as below.
The 001.csv contains some columns to fill to Report.html.
1. Is that possible in any case to keep the leading zero in CSV file so after the file is saved from Excel, iMacros still can read the correct one, as 001 but not 1 as now.
2. How can I put command to check/revise the COL1 so if it detects COL1 < 10, to put COL1 as 01 (then 001 to be similar).

Im using Windows 10 / iMacro Editor 12.0.0.151 / Excel 2017 / IE11.

TAG not triggering a download,"On Windows 10 Pro x64, iMacros Browser V12.5.503.8802
My knowledge of iMacros is mostly using the recorder and making very basic changes as needed.

My macro navigates a reporting page, generates a report, clicks a ""Download to Excel"" text hyperlink, but for some reason does not trigger the download. The TAG command appears to be functioning correctly because a box is placed over the hyperlink in the iMacros ui. If I manually click the hyperlink in the iMacros Browser, the download triggers immediately. I experimented with the SAVETARGETAS, but had the same issue. 

The error I receive is: Error -1410: No download detected.

"[Youtube]Subscribe, get video title and input it to a Spreadsheet","Hi guys

I have to do this following task

*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

Thank you for helping us to help you better!","

EXTRACT and ONDOWNLOAD,"Hello folks!
Windows 7, iMacros for Firefox 8.9.7, Firefox 54.0.1 (32-bit)

I'm an iMacros beginner and I need your help.

I want to extract description of a file and then present it in a message box, after the file is downloaded.
I used EXTRACT=TXT command, but because of this command, iMacro doesn't download the file anymore:
Code: Select allTAB T=1
URL GOTO=http://tcmb.gov.tr/wps/wcm/connect/TCMB+EN/TCMB+EN/Main+Menu/STATISTICS/Tendency+Surveys/Business+Tendency+Statistics+and+Real+Sector+Confidence+Index/Data

TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:Business<SP>Tendency<SP>Survey<SP>and<SP>Real<SP>Sector* EXTRACT=TXT
prompt File:<SP>{{!EXTRACT}}<SP>downloaded!
I doubled the entry (one without that EXTRACT=TXT command) and now it works:
Code: Select allTAB T=1
URL GOTO=http://tcmb.gov.tr/wps/wcm/connect/TCMB+EN/TCMB+EN/Main+Menu/STATISTICS/Tendency+Surveys/Business+Tendency+Statistics+and+Real+Sector+Confidence+Index/Data

TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:Business<SP>Tendency<SP>Survey<SP>and<SP>Real<SP>Sector* EXTRACT=TXT
prompt File:<SP>{{!EXTRACT}}<SP>downloaded!
It's just, I don't think it is supposed to look that way.
I'd like to write codes as good as possible.
Could you possibly tell me how my code should look like?

Plus, is it possible to present just a part of extracted text?
I mean in this case: instead of prompting whole ""Business Tendency Survey and Real Sector Confidence Index (July 2017)"" iMacro would prompt just ""(July 2017)"".","

"Choose pdf name dynamically by variable does not work, datetime only","Dear friends, 

Imacros Version: 10.0.5
Chrome: Vers茫o 71.0.3578.98
OS: Windows 10 64 bits

I trying download some open pdf's in som sites, for example here I will put this site:
https://www.wdl.org/pt/item/18529/

So the title of this page is ""Val锚ncia. Mercado"", I want extract the title of many pages to put in pdf name when downloaded. 

My script working with dynmi datetime:
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=H1 ATTR=ID:page-title EXTRACT=TXT
SET !VAR1 {{!EXTRACT}}
TAG SELECTOR=""#downloads>LI>A""
ONDOWNLOAD FOLDER=* FILE=+_{{!NOW:yyyymmdd_hhnnss}} WAIT=YES
TAG SELECTOR=""#downloads>LI>UL>LI:nth-of-type(2)>A""

So, when I download using this above code, the name of archive comes:  ""18529_20181223_223412"", this proof that the datetime dynamicaly works.

But when I try put the title page as filename dinamycaly (to work in another pages), dont work, see my script:

Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=H1 ATTR=ID:page-title EXTRACT=TXT
SET !VAR1 {{!EXTRACT}}
TAG SELECTOR=""#downloads>LI>A""
ONDOWNLOAD FOLDER=* FILE=+_{{!VAR1}} WAIT=YES
TAG SELECTOR=""#downloads>LI>UL>LI:nth-of-type(2)>A""


I thinks must be some simple action to solve this (because the dynamic datetime works, some the name by variable must work by logical thinking), I try many things and dont work, someone can help with this?

Questions on data valadation and extraction to CSV,"This has been written again as I was corrected for my previous attempt 
In the small amount code below I would like to do the following:

1. verify that the searched value appears on the page that was retrieved
     If so then proceed with text extraction
     If not then write a simple text string to a field in the excel file were data will be extracted to. EXAMPLE -  search value (col1) / not found (col2)
2. In the code below POS 7 and POS 8 are associated.  I would like to write them on the same row in excel. EXAMPLE - search  value (col1 row 1) POS7 (col 3 row 1) POS* ( col4 row 1)
3. After all data has been written for that search value, write the next search value data on a new row in the excel file
4. Loop through this until all items have been searched.

I hope this is more clear.

In this version I can select the div element I want to extract but it saves the whole page.
I only want to save the div element.

It would be realy nice if someone could point me in the right direction.

Loop inputs through csv while scrapping,"Hey everyone. My code is below. What I am trying to do is loop the inputs the contents of cells in my csv file in --> ""client CONTENT=cell contents "" (4th line from the bottom). So, my csv has a bunch of client codes, and I am trying to get the macro to log in to my account, get the client code from the csv file, input it in the box, go to the page and extract a certain line. After that, i want it to go back to main page, go to the next line in the csv file (so second client) and input the second code. Keep doing this until the csv has no more lines. My current code stops after the first input from the csv file. 

I am using the iMacros Browser and there is no loop options. I attached a picture of what the display is. 

Does anyone know how I can do this? Thank you in advance!

Extracting data of JSON,"Hey all,

I'm trying to extract part of a JSON web page to find a specific part in it.

What I want to try to use, is this command :

SET N EVAL(""var json2 = JSON.parse('{{!EXTRACT}}');"")

But I received this error :
JScript statement in EVAL contains the following error: Variable 'JSON' has not been declared. Line 6: SET N EVAL(""var json2 = JSON.parse('{{!EXTRACT}}');"")

I am using iMacros Browser 12 on WIndows Server 2012 R2

Most of the example I have seen of the JSON.parse command seems like they were using iMacros for FF, so I'm wondering if it's only available on that.

Thanks

For now, my script is very simple.

extract DIV text with (maybe) relative positioning,"Hello

I have the following structure:
Code: Select all<div class=""left"">
  <h2>title</h2>
  <div class=""cls"">
    <a>link</a>
    some text
  </div>
  <div class=""cls"">
    <a>link</a>

    some text
  </div>
  <div class=""cls"">
    <a>link</a>
    some text
  </div>
</div>
... about 30 times

Unfortunately <div class=""left""> can be positioned in various places in the page, so I cannot use XPath to get to it or to any of the inside divs
There's also no telling what comes next. Lastly the <div class=""cls""> can be found in various other places in the page.
So is there a way to extract the text of the divs inside? 
Ideally, is there a way to say extract the text from body > div.content > div.left > div:nth-child(2) or (3) or (30)?

The whole structure
would be something like:
Code: Select allbody
  content
    div.title
    div.intro text
    div.short abstract
    div.gallery
    div.left
    div.right
    div.links
    div.bio
    div.more text
  /content
/body

The only ones that will always appear on any page are the div.title and div.left","

Extracted Values Include Unwanted Labels,"Good Afternoon - 

I am trying to configure an iMacros job which will collect 2 numerical values from 4 web pages then save them into a CSV daily for import into a report.  I've gotten it to mostly work except for one small issue which I need help with, please.

I used the wizard to browse to and select the values, choosing to ""Add command"" after each.  Only the numbers were selected, but the ""Extracted"" box shows the labels next to the numbers as well.  I continued to see what the output would be and once I ran the job, it created a CSV which included both the label and value.  Below is a screenshot of just the value ""28"" selected, yet it shows ""Consumed 28 28"" in ""Extracted.""  The resulting CSV for that is also """"Consumed 28""


The macro string which captures the data is below.  
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=LABEL ATTR=ID:Consumed_label EXTRACT=TXT

I've looked through online help, but cannot figure out how to just get it to grab the numerical value.  Any suggestions?

Bonus Question 
Once I get this figured out, I will need to find a way to import all 8 extracted values into an existing Excel report.  If anyone has any suggestions or links that would help, I'd really appreciate it.

Thank You!","

How can I use iMacros 12 on Windows 8 to extract the following data from all physicians on the above website in a loop using the iMacros Browser?

I need

telephone number
homepage
Office hours from Monday to Sunday

To view this data, click on the ""View profile"" button for each data record from the overview page.

To load all data, click on ""Show more"" at the end of each page.
How do I know that there is a ""Show more"" button?
When are all data records saved?

extracting data same web but different pages,"Dear all,
I am evaluating the iMacros product, in general I do find it as an useful tool and before to buy it I wanted to check how powerful tool it is and here is the point, since I am trying to scrap data from a web (made with wordpress) which has (apparently) tables in hundreds of pages which are similar but not the same. 

I am posting here an example of a command I did create in order to extract only a row which reports some data from one webpage: 

1- TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=VALIGN:top EXTRACT=TXT 
2- SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=* FILE=*
3- TAG POS=5 TYPE=TD ATTR=VALIGN:top EXTRACT=TXT
4- TAG POS=6 TYPE=TD ATTR=VALIGN:top EXTRACT=TXT
5- TAG POS=7 TYPE=TD ATTR=VALIGN:top EXTRACT=TXT
6- TAG POS=8 TYPE=TD ATTR=VALIGN:top EXTRACT=TXT
7- TAG POS=9 TYPE=TD ATTR=VALIGN:top EXTRACT=TXT
8- TAG POS=10 TYPE=TD ATTR=VALIGN:top EXTRACT=TXT


When I create a LOOP, the page 2 and following ones have same header (here as above at line 1) but different positions. It makes impossible to scrap hundreds of pages, because the output comes with a .csv file with an irregular structure, not possible to use for further job.

I might be wrong using the script but in your experience, is there any solution that would help me?
Hoping to have been clear in my explanation, otherwise please post me further questions, I'll be more than glad to reply you. 

p.s. I am using windows 8.1 / iMacros browser","

EXTRACT=CHECKED wont find check box,"Hey guys, need a little help here. 

Windows 10 Pro
iMacros Browser V12.0.501.6698
iMacros BUILD=12.0.501.6698

I have a check box and I am trying to select the check box if it is not selected.  

To start out I have seen this thread https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?t=27248
and I have the main concept down I just cannot get the EXTRACT to return a YES or NO.

Here is my code using regular record:
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=12.0.501.6698
TAB T=1
TAB CLOSEALLOTHERS
URL GOTO=https://www.b50first.com/prod/login_app.aspx
TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT ATTR=NAME:tbCompany CONTENT=xx
TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT ATTR=NAME:tbUser CONTENT=xx
TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:PASSWORD ATTR=NAME:tbPassword CONTENT=xx
TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:SUBMIT ATTR=NAME:bLogin
TAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=TXT:Reports
TAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=TXT:GL<SP>Account<SP>Balances
'New tab opened
TAB T=2
TAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=ID:ctl00_cph_ctl02_MainLocTree_tree_SelAll_D  'This line selects check box


here is the line when I use the expert recorder:
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN FORM=NAME:aspnetForm ATTR=ID:ctl00_cph_ctl02_MainLocTree_tree_SelAll_D&&CLASS:dxWeb_edtCheckBoxUnchecked_1<SP>dxICheckBox_1 'Unchecked Box
TAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN FORM=NAME:aspnetForm ATTR=ID:ctl00_cph_ctl02_MainLocTree_tree_SelAll_D&&CLASS:dxWeb_edtCheckBoxChecked_1<SP>dxICheckBox_1 'Checked Box

So I either get two returns, the one below returns that EXTRACT=CHECKED only works on check boxes:
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN FORM=NAME:aspnetForm ATTR=ID:ctl00_cph_ctl02_MainLocTree_tree_SelAll_D EXTRACT=CHECKED

This line returned an error saying the extract value is #EANF#:
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=HIDDEN FORM=NAME:aspnetForm ATTR=ID:ctl00_cph_ctl02_MainLocTree_tree_SelAll_D EXTRACT=CHECKED

Additionally here is the HTML from the website that selects the checkbox (I think):
Code: Select all<input type=""hidden"" name=""ctl00$cph$ctl02$MainLocTree$tree$STATE"" id=""ctl00_cph_ctl02_MainLocTree_tree_STATE"" value=""Y2dkZ2ACYQYQUChyYGdkYmT7/5+dgZ2V/Q2Q5AIKs3MzsRoZWhgbQygTCGUKpIxMLMwglDmQMjE0AMlZWpiZQShzCGUBoiwNTSGUGdBUNiY2v/yUVE8XdiaegMSi1LwSGJfNvaggPsCbmYnNJz8ZzOAASYWkVpSwg8X8korY2RkA"">

Any advise on why it isn't finding the checkbox?

Crawling a site to make site map,"Hi,

There's an informative site that does not provide a site map and I want to make one for my own use in referring to the information it provides. I'm looking to see if I can accomplish this with iMacros. What I need to do is crawl the site and extract the text and URLs for internal links on all its pages, saving them in some sort of tree that indicates the hierarchy of the links. Also, the site does have section menus in the left margin, and I could construct a full site map by just extracting those and knitting them together.

Is it possible to do that with the FireFox add-on?

As a brute-force method, I could also do it if I can just crawl all the links to URLs within the site and download the HTML for all pages and use a text editor to manually extract link tags and then arrange those in the proper order. I could do that if I just have the ability to crawl the links and download the pages.

I looked through the iMacros Wiki page on ""Data Extraction"" and didn't see anything on how to crawl a site. I searched the Wiki for ""crawl"" and for ""site map"" and got no results. I looked through the forum on ""How-To's and Examples for Web Scraping"" and didn't see anything that seems applicable. And I did a search in this forum (Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping) for ""crawl"" and ""site map"" and found one thread (http://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=3291) that referred to the Wiki page on Web Scripting, which apparently requires the Enterprise edition, which I don't have, and which also does not say anything directly about crawling.

So, two bottom line questions:
* Can a site be crawled using a free version of iMacros? 
* Is there documentation somewhere specifically on how to use iMacros to crawl a site?

Thanks for your help.


The requested background info is:
1. What version of iMacros are you using? - iMacros for Firefox 8.8.2
2. What operating system are you using? - Windows 7 Pro 64-bit English
3. Which browser(s) are you using? - FireFox v 30.0","

When I create my macro on iMacros, I just underline the price with my mouse : TAG POS=1 TYPE=P ATTR=TXT:5,76<SP>鈧?But if I run my macro again and that this price changed, it still indicate 5.76 euros.
My question : how to extract in a better way dynamic informations ? Then I want this information in a csv.

Variable reading and timeout loop,"Hi everyone! I'm just got iMacros cause I need it to create a bot for my economical simulator. In this game, you have to fight 10 times a day and work once to get paid.
If there are people who want to help, I would really appriciate it.
The theory it's simple, but I have no ideea how to write the code.

My plan is to write this bot that it can automatically fight 10 times, with a break of 10 minutes between each fight. I could do this by simply recording the macro, but there are some problems.
I can't beat someone who has more energy than me. So, I'm looking for a code that can read my victim's energy, and if the number is bigger than 5 (for example), than return and find another one who has less.
I've put here a printscreen that shows how this menu looks. The code should read vitim's energy from this menu, check if it is bigger than 5 and return to the list for searching another one with less energy. Or if it's possible to figure out from the begining the one that has less than 5% energy, why not.
I've thought that going by inspect element in chrome may help me. I located the line where energy is displayed, but I have no ideea how to write the code.

I've started building this code, but it can only do simple tasks cause I dont know how to improve it yet.

You can notice here that I copied the tasks because there are 10 fights to do and I want the macro to keep running. As I said, there is a timeout of 10min between fights, and I added that with a difference of couple seconds 
so I'm safe from getting banned, cause they could check that I'm doing my fights every day at the same interval. I will keep editing this timeout.
So, besides variable reading, I would also need a loop with an timeout of 10min between each task group.

I really want to learn some coding commands, as a begginer. If you guys can help me with that, I would really appriciate it.

As a summary, I need a code for reading variables who can chose the victim that has the energy under 5% and a loop one, with a timeout of 10mins between each fight, who would simplify that long code.
A tested fight, is defined by that:
Code: Select allURL GOTO=http://www.marketglory.com/account

Extract image path from table,"Specialty electrics draw eyes at July series CHICAGO -- Whether it was the free food or the products themselves, lots of the buyers in the NHMA Mid-Year Show here gravitated toward stalls with specialty kitchen electrics.

>> http://bitly.com/best-masticating-juicer
On display were an variety of appliances such as pastamakers, ice cream makers, breadmakers, cappuccino/espresso makers, juicers and waffle irons. While producers touted their goods, fresh bread, pasta, ice cream, cappuccino and espresso were prepared and served directly before the eyes -- and upset -- of attendees.
Judging from the numbers watching the food preparations take place, the interest level in the specialty market was large. And, many manufacturers agreed that the desire for specialty items is slowly increasing. However, according to some producers, only a few of the items now in the specialty niche are expected to profit from the increase in interest. In fact, most manufacturers of specialty products agreed that items such as pasta makers and ice cream manufacturers are leveling off either because of saturation in the market or because of what they predict overspecialization.

According to Lou Federico, divisional manager of kitchen products at Conair Corp., pastamakers and ice cream manufacturers are weakening. The reason, he explained, is these products need too much time and effort from consumers while delivering relatively few benefits and little convenience.
""We (Conair Corp.) have been assessing new niche categories. The market for pastamakers appears to be retrenching. Ice cream makers have also weakened. The biggest hangup in retail with ice cream manufacturers is the fact that it takes a lot of work to make something that's simpler to purchase already made."" Galileo Buzzi-Ferraris, president of Lello Appliances, distributor of Simac goods, concurred that interest in pastamakers is subsiding. He clarified that the availability of fresh pasta in many grocers' freezers has diminished the need for customers to exert the time and effort to make pasta at home.
Buzzi-Ferraris' view is that""the high-end ice cream business has been screwed-up when Donvier introduced its guide ice cream maker, which retails for just about $30."" Consequently, he said, prices for the whole marketplace were reduced. ""Now to sell huge numbers of (high end ) ice cream machines is quite hard,"" he added.

>> https://medium.com/@bestmasticatingjuic ... 01a47a8d59
In response to the Donvier unit, Simac is now offering the Gelato Pronto; a $79 manual ice cream maker. In accordance with Buzzi-Ferraris the reduced priced device is selling quite well. As for Donvier, federal sales manager Alice Shoemaker responded,""I don't believe we screwed it up,"" referring to reduced priced ice cream manufacturers. ""I think what we have done is altered the marketplace.""

Tom Fletcher, vice president of advertising at Gourmet Housewares, distributor of a line of Gaggia products, including a manual ice cream maker, also disagreed with Buzzi-Ferraris. He argued that lower priced ice cream manufacturers really extend the market. According to Fletcher,""There is a big difference between a $30 ice cream manufacturer and also a $600 unit"" He added that customers who purchase one would not be interested in the other.
One area where the two Gaggia's Fletcher and Simac's Buzzi-Ferraris did agree is the fact that cappuccino/espresso manufacturers are strong and should continue to rise tremendously. To fulfill the consumer demand for specialty coffee manufacturers, the two companies are marketing new blend cappuccino/espresso machines. ""Right now,"" said Fletcher,""cappuccino/espresso machines are in vogue, probably because customers are traveling more and therefore are exposed to various sorts of coffees. The American people as a whole is growing more sophisticated regarding the consumption of coffee and consequently they are looking for variety.""

Buzzi-Ferraris agreed. ""The cappuccino/espresso marketplace is big, and it is getting even larger. We are responding to this growing market by developing a fully automatic device that will make it even simpler to make espresso and cappuccino coffees. We'll introduce our newest cappuccino/espresso machine at the January Housewares Show (1990)."" According to Conair's Lou Federico, juicers and juice extractors are different examples of specialty items with growth potential.

>> https://www.facebook.com/Bestmasticatingjuicers.zones
""I visit two merchandise trends, first there is the juicer that squeezes out the juice of soft fruits and vegetables -- for example, oranges, grapefruits and berries. Then there's the juice extractor which pulls out juices from fruits and vegetables that don't seem juicy -- for instance, carrots, pears and apples. I think the products are being driven by the health trend, which has been around for a while and the diet craze, which frequently requires drinking considerable quantities of juices""
Presently, Conair Corp. is advertising a juicer and based on Federico, can be looking seriously at juice extractors. As with other manufacturers, Federico agreed that the secret to manufacturing specialty goods is twofold. ""Specialty electrics must provide benefits and conveniences,"" said Federico. ""If we (Conair) look at a specialty merchandise, we ask ourselves,'Can it be providing a benefit?' And'Can it be providing a benefit?' If the solution is no, we're not interested.""

He added,""We looked at breadmakers and decided it was too specialized. The final result is a small amount of bread which requires numerous hours to bake.""
On the flip side, Keizo Kawanishi, executive vice president of Zojirushi America Corp., pointed out that not all breadmakers are equally. By way of example, he said the Zojirushi breadmaker provides consumers versatility, he noted is an aspect many customers are searching for in specialty products.
""Other companies,"" explained Kawanishi,""have components that just bake bread. Our apparatus can bake cakes, bread and make jams. A great deal of people at the (Mid-Year) Show showed interest in our breadmakers. Consumers often get breadmakers for individual use, and later purchase them as presents.""","

Macro perfomance slow when extracting table from javascript,"VERSION BUILD=11.5.498.2403,  Windows 7 , IE11

The following macro extracts a HTML table to csv file.  There are approximately 14,000 rows in the table.  When I run the macro from the IMacros Browser in IE the macro extracts the file in less than one minute.  When I attempt to execute the macro from javascript  using iimPlay the macro runs for more than 30 minutes and never returns any results.  If I execute the same macro using iimPlay on a smaller table(12 rows) the macro returns the csv file.

Is there a setting or something I can check while executing the macro from javascript to get the same performance I get when executing the macro in IMacros browser?

I have an input list of which I'm trying to match against LinkedIn details. The script it self works perfectly. However after a nominal amount of loops (some times 10 sometimes 100) one of the following will happen:

- iMacros will keep steping through commands however it doesn't seem to pass them onto the browser
- IE / Macros will crash

I'd obviously prefer to run this in Chrome / FF but I don't believe I can use the EXTRACT or SAVEAS command without purchasing the full license. Any ideas of work arounds I need to go through over 3000 inputs and it's killing me to have to continiously have to check on it?","

How to retrieve the name of the downloaded PDF document?,"Hi,

I am using iMacros Version10 and want to retreive the name of a PDF document that is stored behind a short link: e.g. http://shortlinks.de/40tr points to https://www.upc.at/pdf/anleitungen/fibe ... n-0517.pdf

The macro in Excel writes the shortlink to the variable {linkname}. Beside downloading the PDF file I also want to hand over the name of the actual file (b2c-installationsanleitung-wlan-0517.pdf) to excel

Here is my macro performing the download, but I did not succeeded in writing the name of the PDF file to a variable:

VERSION BUILD=10002738
TAB T=1
TAB CLOSEALLOTHERS
Set !errorignore yes
ONDOWNLOAD FOLDER=C:\CHECK_Links FILE=* WAIT=YES
URL GOTO={{linkname}}
TAB T=1

I hope, that there must be some simple solution or trick for this task.

Thank you very much for your support!

*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

Thank you for helping us to help you better!","

Extract Data and Paste to Field with existing text,"So I just purchased the program for the file data extraction option and I'm having some trouble figuring out how to make it work. 

I have a CSV file with two columns.  Column 1 has a number that needs to be searched, and column 2 has a code that I need inserted into a field with existing information in that numbers page.  

For example:
Column 1  Column 2

Can anyone help with the data extraction that changes to each row every loop?","

Can't get Imacros to download a PDF,"IE = 11.09600.18893
IMACROS=12.0501.6698

Hi, I would appreciate if someone can help me figure this one out or lead me to the where i can read additional materials so i can figure out myself.

Currently after the last command, a pop up window will pop up and reveal the available documents to download. The problems are 1) the POS is different everytime. I know how to use relative position, but I can't figure out what is the anchor to use. 2)the biggest problem is, even if I know the TAG POS to use for the download link, when I enter that command to the Imacros, it wouldn't do anything. For example, in the example provided below, I used Imacros recording function to figure out the command for the download link is TAG POS=19 TYPE=TD ATTR=* , but when I manually enter the command in the script before, it didn't do anything.

Code: Select allSET !ERRORIGNORE YES

!WAITPAGECOMPLETE vs Wait Time,"I have a relatively slow loading set of pages that I am using to scrape data. Initially I had problems with the script getting ahead of itself and causing problems by advancing too quickly. I initially tried the Wait feature and that helped a lot. I later tried the !WAITPAGECOMPLETE command thinking that it would be a more efficient way of handling slow loading pages. Unfortunately, it doesn't work as well as putting in somewhat arbitrary Wait commands. I would still get some advancement to the next page when the first page wasn't complete yet. Am I missing something with the WAITPAGECOMPLETE command or am I better off using the Wait command?","

iMacros Script to Extract Specific Text From Static Position,"Problem Description Information:
1. iMacros Version: iMacros for Firefox 8.9.7 (VERSION BUILD=8970419)
2. Windows 10 (64-bit) [English]
3. Firefox 45.9.0
4. Included demos work ok.
5. Included VBS sample scripts run ok.
6. Not applicable/no specific recording or replay fails on a specific website.
7. Not applicable/no test for encounter of the same problem with the: iMacros Browser, iMacros for Internet Explorer, iMacros for Firefox, and iMacros for Chrome.

Problem:
I am trying to write an iMacros script that checks a webpage, and in that webpage checks a specific webpage position for a specific text that is positioned always to the right of a naming text that always has the same position on that webpage (naming text is: ""Location:"") where the value of this specific text to the right of that naming text can change between 1 to 26 different values (say: A-Z), Once iMacros ""reads"" this specific text, then have iMacros take that specific text and look it up in a specific Excel file where that specific text has specific values (say: A to Z) located in column A and then have iMacros return the corresponding output value from column B (say: 101-126) on the same row.
How would I script this in iMacros?

So far, using the iMacros built in recorder I have made the following progress in iMacros (webpage image with iMacros recorder ""blue boxes"" listed below):
Script:
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=8970419 RECORDER=FX

TAG POS=1 TYPE=TD ATTR=TXT:Location:
WAIT SECONDS=1
TAG POS=1 TYPE=TD ATTR=TXT:SPECIFIC-TEXT
WAIT SECONDS=1

I have pasted below an image of the webpage I am trying to script for; where it needs to read the ""specific text"" located to the right of the text ""Location:"" where that text is always in the same position on the webpage and always to the right of ""Location:"" - how would I script this in iMacros?

SET !EXTRACT NULL no longer work. It's probably tied to the concatenate issue for the !EXTRACT variable.

iMacros Script to Run Excel Macro?,"Problem Description Information:

3. Firefox 45.9.0

6. Not applicable/no specific recording or replay fails on a specific website.
7. Not applicable/no test for encounter of the same problem with the: iMacros Browser, iMacros for Internet Explorer, iMacros for Firefox, and iMacros for Chrome.

Problem:
I am currently working on an iMacros script, and I am asking if there is a code that will allow iMacros to run an Excel macro?

For example something like:
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=8970419 RECORDER=FX
WAIT SECONDS=1
TAB T=1
URL GOTO=http://*URL*/

*iMACROS CODE*

WAIT SECONDS=1
URL GOTO=imacros://run/?m=#Macro2

But instead of ending with running ""Macro2"" it runs an Excel macro instead; how would I do this in iMacros?

I tried the below code, and this did not work.
Code: Select allURL GOTO=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office13\EXCEL.exe

EDIT: Progress Update
Courtesy of the wiki: http://wiki.imacros.net/URL; I was able to find the ""URL GOTO="" command for running local files in Windows.
Code: Select allURL GOTO=file:///C:\Directory\TEST.CSV

As a result, I was able initiate the running of an Excel (.CSV) file where the ""URL GOTO="" triggers the browser prompt window below. How would I code iMacros to open the local file, and not download it?

Extract a URL from a link and then download PDF it links to?,"iMacros: VERSION BUILD=8970419
OS: Windows 7
Browser: Firefox 47
Demos Work: Yes
VBS Scripting: Yes
URL: N/A
IMacros work on other version: N/A

I am trying to extract a URL from a link, and then tell iMacros to ""download""/""save target as"" the URL it extracts, and download the file from that URL.
Specifically, I am trying to retrieve the second link (the PDF file), named ""*"":


Specifically, when I use the ""record"" feature in iMacros and click on the link it retrieves the link as:
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=ID:URL$1
TAB T=2

(Where the second line has the PDF opening in the second tab as an opened PDF file)

But when I mouse over the link it retrieves the ""name"" of the link as: ""URLID"" and the actual URL as: ""https://*/*.PDF"".

Using the code:
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=ID:URL$1 EXTRACT=HREF

Allows me to extract the actual URL as: ""https://*/*.PDF""

But what code do I use to tell iMacros to:
1) take that actual URL it extracts and
2) use that actual URL it extracts, and then ""download""/""save target as"" that actual URL, so that the PDF that actual URL links to (since the actual URL ends in "".PDF"") actually downloads the PDF file?

EDIT 1: Updated to edit out some extraneous information.
EDIT 2: Chivracq, I updated my original post to remove some extraneous information if you would please edit your reply to requote my updated edited post to reflect the extraneous information removed I would appreciate. Once your reply is edited to requote my updated edited post; I can then post my solution to this post that I was able to solve thanks to you, so others can benefit.","

Stopping the word [EXTRACT] from appearing in extracted text,"Hi guys

Really simple question, hope it's equally simple to answer!

I am trying to extract a list of postcodes from a website as follows:

TAG POS=1 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:POSCTODE&&TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT
ADD !EXTRACT <BR><LF>
TAG POS=2 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:POSCTODE&&TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT
ADD !EXTRACT <BR><LF>
TAG POS=3 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:POSTCODE&&TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT

But when I retrieve it, although I get the data with carriage returns, the word [EXTRACT] is included free of charge on every line!!

What do I need to fix it?

Thanks

Search list > Extract List > Download page,"Hello, 

I'm new to Imacros and to the community. 

I'm trying to figure out the following: 

1) Go to this State Gov't website (http://apps.dor.wa.gov/BRD/default.aspx#brdResults)

2) Search an entity (Amazon.com for example) from a list (a table in html format)

3) If the search returned multiple hits, do nothing and move on to the next entity on the list. 

4) If the search returned one hit, click on the result.

4) After clicking on the result, the next page will display the entity information (address, account open, etc).  Extract the information to a excel spreadsheet

5) download webpage and move on to next entity on the list and repeat.


Eventually, I would need to figure out how to repeat this process for different websites, but I'm hoping if I can get some help with the first one I can try to learn and figure out for others.

Thanks!","

How to create and reference a text file,"I am using Firefox on a 64 bit windows 10 OS.


My name is Christian. I am a newbie and just recently I installed the iMacro plugin.

I am trying to create a macro that does the following:
1. Copy a line of text from a Single colum CSV file
2.Go to blogger.com>>Create New Post
3. Paste the text in the ""Title"" box and click on publish.
4.Repeat steps 1-3 for the subsequent lines in the text file until the last line.

My problem.
The imacro I recorded cannot reference a text file

Here is the code:
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=9030808 RECORDER=FX
TAB T=1

wait seconds=10
TAG POS=2 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=NAME:postingForm ATTR=* CONTENT=Oga
TAG POS=1 TYPE=BUTTON FORM=NAME:postingForm ATTR=TXT:Publish

This is the path to the CSV file:C:\Users\la~tino\Documents\iMacros\Datasources\alumini.CSV

Thanks for your most anticipated solution","

At this stage in the script anyway, the goal is just to strip out quotes.  Later on similarly so for URL substrings.

I want to extract information from the site but it's dynamic,"454/5000  
I come from China. The English language is very poor, which is translated by translation software. I'm learning imacros now, and I have a problem.
Q: How do I extract information from a table with variable length and/or more than one page?
I can't understand.
I want to extract information from the site but it's dynamic. My code looks like this.
Macro =macro+""TAG POS={XX} TYPY=TD ATTR=*EXTRACT=TXT""+.
vbNewLine
XX is changed. How can I get the value of XX?
Once you get the #EANF# message back instead of a result you know that you reached the end of the table on the current page.
I don't understand that I don't know how to write code can I give you a simple example?","

Trimming a word off the extract value using EVAL + .substr?,"iMacros for Firefox 9.0.3//Firefox 49.0.2//Windows 10 Pro [Eng]

So I'm going a little nuts here. I haven't used iMacros in a long time (last post on this account was 2011) and I seem to have forgotten a lot. But I had a problem automating some link clicking and I thought, hey that old iMacros extension might work! So here I am.

So my end goal for my script is to click on several hyperlinked downloads (.torrent files) to automate the downloading process for me.

First problem:
The amount of torrents on the page change, depending on what specific page you're looking at. Some pages on the site may have 7 torrents, others have 2.
Luckily the site lists the amount of torrents on a page in a text attribute (literal text is 'Torrents x').
So first, I need to extract the 'x'. Through quite a bit of searching, it seems the best way to do this is using EVAL + javascript to manipulate the extraction. I settled on using substr because I only need the last value for the extraction and the word Torrents is always the same amount of characters. This is what I have so far:
Code: Select allSET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO
TAG POS=1 TYPE=LI ATTR=TXT:Torrents:<SP>* EXTRACT=TXT
SET !VAR1 EVAL(""'{{!EXTRACT}}'.substr(10,1);"")
PROMPT {{!var1}}
Now, I know that I've got some wrong syntax in there, I'm just not fully understanding where it's at/what is wrong. I know it's something with the EVAL because if I just use SET !VAR1 {{!EXTRACT}} instead of the EVAL in the same code, I get the prompt: Torrents: x. So everything's working, all I want is the correct syntax for trimming Torrents:<SP> off and having VAR1=x.
--------------------------
My second problem (getting ahead of myself a bit here but better to ask now I guess):
This is the line of code to click on the download links. Basically there are multiple instances of this text on the page, all corresponding to links to different torrents. Each torrent link looks like this: 
[DownLoad]
So to find those links and click on them I use:
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:DownLoad
TAG POS=2 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:DownLoad
TAG POS=3 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:DownLoad
etc...
What I need is to use the VAR1 from my first problem above and have it define the maximum amount of TAG POS to use. Basically if there's 23 torrents on the site, I need it to run:
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:DownLoad
...
TAG POS=23 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:DownLoad.
How would I go about doing that? I understand I can use TAG POS={{!var1}} to find the final DownLoad but I'm not sure how to use that to count up or how to design it so it stops the code after a certain amount.

Hopefully I explained myself clearly enough, if you need anymore information feel free to ask me to clarify. There's probably a much simpler way of doing this but I'm obviously clueless as to what it is.","

"Download pdf/audio/video from page, click next page do same","Dear friends, I hope I can find some help, is my first time with imacros (I know algorithms, but I've never used imacros).

I am a participant in a website with videos and study material in pdf, and I want to download them so I can watch and study offline.

So, I'm logged into the page, and I'm going to the course I want to download, link:
https: //www.****.com/course/cod/sc%6CTU1EaL7Z%9W/v/OQlrb2uhlnS%9W/c/KvcHnMerTdz%9W

I tried, with Chrome Imacros recording function of imacros to save  each action and repeating it to do the operation in next pages, I'll attach the script so you understand.

In the page, I download the video, I use the Adobe HDS / HLS Video Saver addon (withou imacros i can download any m3u8 with this addon), the link to open the addon is:
chrome-extension://pibndofbpkoaipoidbkephfhhnapkccn/download.html

Is possible record actions of a another addon? even if this addon is just a new tab with specifc functions?
In this link, the m3u8 file is brought by clicking on the link inside the addon, the addon joins the parts and the download of a unified file of the video.
Then I click clear and close the tab.

I go back to the first page, and I click to download the pdf booklet and then click to download the pdf slide and after downlaod the audiofile.

Then I click on the next page, where there same structure page with a new video and other materials and I have re-created the process on this new page.

However the script is static, I want to leave it dynamic, to go on going on each page by clicking the ""next page"" button and the materials being downloaded in each one.

Another detail, that in the static there are some problems, in this part:
GOTO URL = chrome-extension://pibndofbpkoaipoidbkephfhhnapkccn/download.html

imacros adds  ""http://"" and ignores after the ""extension"" the "":"" and try to open in the new tab like this, imacros try open this:
http://chrome-extension//pibndofbpkoaip ... nload.html

1 - How do I open it in the new tab exactly ""chrome-extension://pibndofbpkoaipoidbkephfhhnapkccn/download.html""    ?

2 - inside this addon page which is a new tab, it seems that imacros did not save the command to click on the link, which makes the addon download the m3u8 and merge all the videos into a single file.
So in this way, as the addon is not opened as per the link above, I can not download the m3u8 video. Its possible use this addon with imacros? if not, any another suggestions to download m3u8 using imacros?

3 - When imacros downloads the contents of this first page, it goes to the next page according to the next page button, but it does not downloads the contents of the second page, but download the contents of the same first page again.
How to make it go to the next page as the button and download the contents of the next page and not the first?

That is, I want to make this dynamic, I did the procedure 3 times to be easy to understand the static imacro to try to make it dynamic.
So I want do a dynamic imacro that will always click ""next page"" automatically regardless of how many pages it is and download the contents of each one of them.

In short, for the time being this static script can download the pdfs and the audio normally, is only with the problem that I mentioned in not downloading the contents of the next page and too the problem of not being able to download the m3u8 video with imacros using the HLS addon.

Problems with Tab opening and find the right atribute,"So, I'm kinda new to Imacros and have only basic knowledge. Long story short, from the  exhibitor list i have, on the exhibition site, i need to extract info about 'em.

https://ces18.mapyourshow.com/7_0/searc ... endrow=200 that's the list.

What i'm tring to do, is to make imacros open exhibitors page in a new tab, scrap the info i need, close it, and repeat with next inline 


 prim1 
 , but i can't find the way to do that, since href's or position arent specified. 
But that is just a part of the problem. Once in that page, i could tell imacros what to copy BUT the email, which i kinda need the most since it's position isnt specified either.

Colon Distrupting The Extraction!!,"Firefox 55; imacros 8.9.7 ; Windows 7

I have been really familiar in coding in imacros, but
This is something new to me.
I found this kind of ID naming,
Code: Select all<div class=""_4-u2 mbm _4mrt _5jmm _5pat _5v3q _4-u8"" data-fte=""1"" data-ftr=""1"" id=""mall_post_1988260348080319:6:0"" role=""article""

Point here: mall_post_1988260348080319:6:0

And next problem, I can only use EVENT Javascript imacros to get it work.
So what I have done,

Extracting ID, and then assigned it to code like this
Code: Select alliimPlayCode (
	""EVENT TYPE=CLICK SELECTOR=\""#mall_post_""+ something +"":6:0>DIV>DIV>DIV:nth-of-type(2)>DIV>DIV>DIV>DIV>DIV>DIV>DIV>DIV>SPAN:nth-of-type(1)>DIV>A\"" BUTTON=0"" + ln
);

Point here: SELECTOR=\""#mall_post_""+ something +"":6:0

Notice the bolded stuff? Yeah you can then assume it won't work. The error message was this,
""Syntax error. [this is line of code] is not a valid selector, line 1 (Error code: -1001)""

I am not sure if I missed some other technique to do this. But really I was really sad if it couldn't be done.

"Find the right Colum to Extract Data, on the 3rd tab opened","Hi everyone,
good morning,

My name is Bruno, I'm brazilian. Sorry by the English. I need to build a code of a extraction in the site http://consulta.plus (with login and password, I can pass if you ask),  but first I need to fill the number of CPF (individual registration) and find the data of the client I'm look for.

Second, the site presents a table to click in anyone data (image1), I click in the line of the table, and the site goes to the table I want do extract the colum of ""Vlr Dispon铆vel"" and below, ""Margem Livre"", right below ""Margem Livre"" (credit card) but I cant to find de right code to find the correct extraction on the table, in a correct column ""Vlr. Dispon铆vel""






I tried to do this code:

macro = ""URL GOTO=http://consulta.plus#!"" + vbNewLine
macro = macro + ""'Get the values"" + vbNewLine

'Verifing the extraction
macro = macro + ""TAG POS=1 TYPE=TH ATTR=TXT:Vlr Dispon铆vel"" + vbNewLine
macro = macro + ""TAG POS=R1 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:bdytxt&&TXT:*.* EXTRACT=TXT "" + vbNewLine

Summing up, I need a code that extract the colum ""Vlr Dispon铆vel"" and down, ""Margem Livre"" and ""Margem Livre"" right below, and make a seach by CPF but when the site find the data of CPF he opens 3 tabs (image2_extract), 

Image 2 extract






How can I find this datas and build the code to find the correct colum?

Any doubt contact me, please.
Thank You","

Scraping dynamic list of links with download filename,"This might be a dumb question, but is iMacros capable of saving all links of a particular class on a page and use the filenames specified in the ""download"" attribute?  Basically I'm using an eBay image scraping tool to generate a list of links to each of a listing's images at maximum resolution, but because of CORS limitations, I must right-click each link to get the save dialog box to use the filename in the ""download"" attribute.  This is fine if there are only a few images, but it gets tedious if a listing as more than a dozen images, so I'm hoping to use a macro to automate this.  Is iMacros what I want?  How would I got about ensuring that the specified filenames are used?

The HTML code looks like this:

<a href=""https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/l5kAAOSw ... -l1600.jpg"" class=""img_link"" id=""img_link_0"" download=""322871381840 s-l1600 0.jpg"">322871381840 s-l1600 0.jpg</a>

Saving CAPTCHA image not working...sooo close,"Hello, 

I am trying to save a captcha image and while it is saving an image it is saving the wrong part of the screen.

I am using:

version:
10022823

Tested in: imacros browser and imacros for IE


Here is my code:
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=10022823

TAB T=1
TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=NAME:createaccount ATTR=NAME:newaccountcaptcha CONTENT=!VAR1
TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:CHECKBOX FORM=NAME:createaccount ATTR=NAME:TermsOfService CONTENT=YES

Everything runs fine but when it processes line 15 in the Imacros browser instead of the captcha image being saved it just saves a portion of the top left of the screen.  In the IE imacros browser it gives this error:
Error -1000: Cannot copy the item being saved to destination file: C:\captcha\captcha.jpg Unable to save screenshot of the current browser page.  Notice that only HTML documents are currently supported  (no PDF or office documents loaded via plugins). Line 15: TAG POS=1 TYPE=IMG FORM=NAME:createaccount ATTR=SRC:*https://accounts.google.com/Captcha?ctoken* CONTENT=EVENT:SAVEPICTUREAS

Which makes sense because there is no file type in the code of the page that specifies the type of file for the CAPTCHA image.  Instead there is a randomly generated ""key"" that is used to reference the image.

I feel very close to getting this to work but something is either out of place/sequence or the references are wrong somehow.

I've spent 3 hours on this and it's driving me nuts    Any ideas?","

iMacros skips lines when pulling from CSV,"VERSION BUILD=10022823

I'm having an issue where iMacros is skipping randomly when pulling from the CSV datasource. It starts at the 3rd line and then skips to the 5th, then skips 10 lines, then another 2, and so on. Here is the code:

VERSION BUILD=10022823
SET !DATASOURCE InfoExtraction.csv
SET !DATASOURCE_COLUMNS 30
SET !DATASOURCE_LINE {{!LOOP}}
SET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO
SET !TIMEOUT_PAGE 600

"!ENDOFPAGE to ""loop""  through tags to extract data","Using iMacros 10, IE 11, Windows 8

I'm trying to extract the text associated with the TD tags from ""cash assets"" row in the following HTML i.e., want to extract ""11,723"",""4,180"",""11,089""  - the number of TD elements can vary
Code: Select all<tr class=""tblDataRow"">
    <td>Cash Assets</td>
    <td align=""right"" style="" white-space: nowrap; "">11,723</td>
    <td align=""right"" style="" white-space: nowrap; "">4,180</td>
    <td align=""right"" style="" white-space: nowrap; "">11,089</td>
  </tr>
<tr class=""tblDataRowAlternate"">
    <td>Receivables</td>
    <td align=""right"" style="" white-space: nowrap; "">18</td>
    <td align=""right"" style="" white-space: nowrap; "">419</td>
    <td align=""right"" style="" white-space: nowrap; "">1,256</td>
  </tr>


Using the following iMacros code
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=TD FORM=NAME:Form1 ATTR=TXT:Receivables
SET !ENDOFPAGE {{!TAGSOURCEINDEX}}
TAG POS=1 TYPE=TD FORM=NAME:Form1 ATTR=TXT:Cash<SP>Assets
TAG POS=R{{myloop}} TYPE=TD ATTR=TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=* FILE=*


but this does not produce any output except #EANF#

However, with the following iMacros code
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=TD FORM=NAME:Form1 ATTR=TXT:Cash<SP>Assets
TAG POS=R1 TYPE=TD ATTR=TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT
TAG POS=R1 TYPE=TD ATTR=TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT
TAG POS=R1 TYPE=TD ATTR=TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=* FILE=*


I get the desired extracted text (however, as mentioned above, the number of ""rows""  can vary and is not always only three.

Advise on what I may be doing wrong with !ENDOFPAGE (and or alternative I should be using) is much appreciated.

macro slows down,"I'm using iMacros to loop through a list of purchase orders on a company owned web site.  It seems like the macro  slows down the longer it goes.  I'm not sure if it is the web site or something with my code.  Below is some of the code to show how the macro works.  The rest of the code is very similar to the examples below.  It's similar to code I've used in the past.  Is there any options or settings that I could change to speed up the macro or is the result of the underlying application?

Negative Relative Extraction Problem,"Hi All,
A total Newbie to iMacros and looking for some help from a more experienced user.

I have a problem with the negative relative extraction on eBay.com

Windows XP SP2
iMacros v6.2
Office 2003 - Using Excel VBA to control the iMacros Browser

I was trying to extract data from the ebay.com website.  The listings are in batches of 50.  I can extract the first 49 items and then it fails on the 50th.  I have tried displaying 100 auctions to a page and it extracts the first 99 items and fails on the 100th - - the 50th items extracts OK in this instance.  I have looked at the source of the eBay page and can see no difference in the formatting of the last item on each page.

To replicate, goto http://www.ebay.com and search for 'toner' (for example) -- at the time of writing there are 24,000+ items for 'toner' split over multiple pages.  I have created a sample macro which demonstrates the problem.  It extracts items 1, 2, 49, and 50 (note:  In my VBA code, I use a loop and pass a variable called Pos to iMacro, change the page and then repeat the process).  The logic I use is to find the time left on the page and then using negative relative positioning to extract the link which conforms to the following syntax - http://cgi.ebay.com/*.

Once you have navigated to the search results, run the simple macro below from within the browser.
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:time*
TAG POS=R-1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:*&&HREF:http://cgi.ebay.com/* EXTRACT=HREF
TAG POS=2 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:time*
TAG POS=R-1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:*&&HREF:http://cgi.ebay.com/* EXTRACT=HREF
TAG POS=49 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:time*
TAG POS=R-1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:*&&HREF:http://cgi.ebay.com/* EXTRACT=HREF
TAG POS=50 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:time*
TAG POS=R-1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:*&&HREF:http://cgi.ebay.com/* EXTRACT=HREF


The first 3 items - 1,2 and 49 extract correctly.  The last item - 50th - fails with #EANF#.

Any suggestions.  I doubt it is a bug with iMacros, but any pointers on my code to do the extract would be appreciated.

Cheers

Opening the Extract Wizard in the iMacros Browser,"I would like to try the Extract Wizard which is described in some articles and tutorials but from what I've read it does not exist in the Firefox version of IMacros (which is what I've been using).  I had no luck installing the Chrome version of IMacros, so that leaves the IMacros Browser.  I'd like to open the IMacros Browser anyway because a lot of tutorials are written from that point of view. 

From what I've read, the independent IMacros browser should launch if I click on iMacros.exe in the Program Files folder. ( It's version 12.0.501.2305. )

However that click results only in an informational sales page which bears no resemblance to the browser depicted in various articles.  In addition, that page ""freezes"" on the screen so that I can get rid of it only with the task manager and sometimes only by rebooting!

I may have been reading outdated instructions on launching the browser.  How do I do it in the current version 12.0.501.2305?

Thanks!","

how to carry TAB memory from one macro to another,"Hello;
running FF 55.0.3 on Win 7 32 bit, imacros ver. v8.9.7

I wonder how to pass TAB memory into the another macro script.
I have two macro scripts, (I could not do the task in one macro file),
java script call the first macro, which opens 2 different websites on 2 TABs,
and do some task forth and back on TAB 1 & TAB 2, when done, java script will run the second macro, 
the second macro suppose to do some task on same opened tabs,
but second macro does not recognize TABs that have been opened in the first macro .

I want the second macro remember the opened TABs to be able to do some other tasks forth and back on these 2 TABs.

How Can I make it work?

"Extract Formatting, curious if there is a better way.","Hiya,

FF = 56.0 (64-bit)
IM = 9.0.3 for Firefox
OS = Windows 7 Professional SP1

I finally got this script to work (ish, under ideal conditions). The problem arises when there are gaps in the extracted data (missing tags), which is totally fine, but it messes up the formatting in the .csv. The columns are all shifted right by the number of tags that are missing.

URL is question: https://www.ontario.ca/environment-and- ... ll-records

Once a region is selected, the relevant records are listed, and then I loop this script for the number of records.

My Script:
Code: Select all
'VARIABLE SETUP
SET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO
SET !ERRORIGNORE YES
SET !TIMEOUT_PAGE 60
SET DELAY 0.2
SET !LOOP 1
SET STEP 7
SET WELLID EVAL(""{{STEP}}*{{!LOOP}}-6"")
SET DATE EVAL(""{{STEP}}*{{!LOOP}}"")
SET DEPTH EVAL(""{{STEP}}*{{!LOOP}}-1"")

'LOOPS THOUGH THE MAIN TABLE LIST
'=================================

WAIT SECONDS={{DELAY}}

'RETURN TO THE MAIN TABLE
TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:Go<SP>Back<SP>to<SP>Map&&ONCLICK:MOECC_UI.goBacktoMap()

WAIT SECONDS=1.5

The only way I have found that kind of works is to append a 'spacer' (""//"") after each extract, which at least allows me to count back the number of columns to reformat with the missing info, and then deleting all the placeholder columns. This can get very tedious when dealing with hundreds of records. 

Is there not a better way?

Thanks in Advance,","

how to loop from certain line of script,"Hi;
running FF 55.0.3 on Win 7 32 bit, imacros ver. v8.9.7

I did use the script on this thread with the help of chivracq
http://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php? ... ail#p70484

but I want to do little more on this, and struggle to make it work,
I want the script skip one or few lines of script and continue.
but I could not figure it out how to do it with imacros, I am not sure if this can be done with imacros coding.
found some js loop script on this site, none I could use for this.

I don't think it is needed to paste the script from the link above, because I need only make the loop thing works.
this is what I want to do:

1- TAB 1- go to google and do a search
2- extract the content of the first page results, and click to the next page of the result
3- TAB 2 ,go to second url e.g. xyz.com
4- paste the data in there, extract new data
5- save the new data to a file
6- go back to line 2( which is On TAB 1, the second page of google result)


and continues to line 5, and then again from line 2.
so it is a loop, only the first time it starts at line 1, the second time and further starts from line 2 until the number of loops ends

I need it to set a number of loops as well, I don't want to do the loop unlimited.

appreciate any help on this.","
