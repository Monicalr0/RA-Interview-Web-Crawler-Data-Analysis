Important Progress iMacros Product Update,"Dear iMacros Customers and Users, 

We are writing to inform you that Progress will be officially discontinuing the Progress iMacros product, with a planned End-Of-Life date of November 30, 2023. 

What does this mean? 
Moving forward, Progress will continue to support the iMacros product and will only provide critical fixes as needed until the EOL date. We will honor all service agreements through the existing term, except for those contracts that go beyond the EOL date. Customers with service agreements that go beyond the EOL date will be contacted separately to discuss their options and next steps. We will continue to offer service agreement renewals that do not exceed the EOL date. 

What are your next steps? 
Please remain on the lookout for more communications from Progress in the coming months, as more information will be made readily available to assist you as you prepare your transition plans.

On behalf of Progress, thank you for your continued partnership and commitment. 

Sincerely,  
The Progress iMacros Team",2
*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

Extracting a First name from a LinkedIn Profile,"Hi - bit of  newb at this.

I'm not trying to fix what ain't broken, but i started playing around, and trying to polish my method, and tried to get imacro to extract the first name from a Linked Profile page and save it with the corresponding email address (allowing me to personalise every email). I can do the FULL name with ease, but I'm admitting defeat with the first name extraction.

data extraction php generated,"i am trying to extract from a textarea. the contents of the text area does not show in the page source. inspect element shows only 1 line of code:

my iMacro looks like this:
TAG POS={{!LOOP}} TYPE=TEXTAREA ATTR=CLASS:formCode&&TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT

during the run, i do see the textarea (form) is selected/outlined.

the saved file contains just quotes. so nothing is extracted? how do i get the contents in the textarea?",2
redoubles doublequotes when saving extracted tag as html,"Hello!
I'm using iMacro 8.9.4 as Firefox-Addon for FF 38.0 on my Linux Mint 17.1-machine with german language. I am pretty new to iMacro, but I have some programming-knowledge.

I try to extract a part of a website and save the output into an html-file. My Code (the last two lines are important):
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=TITLE ATTR=TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT
SET !VAR1 EVAL(""\""{{!EXTRACT}}\"".replace(/([0-9]+)/,\""$1.html\"");"")
SET !EXTRACT NULL
TAG POS=1 TYPE=div ATTR=class:main EXTRACT=HTM
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=~/path/to/file/ FILE={{!VAR1}} 

When I open the output-File. it looks like this:
Code: Select all""<div style=""""style-info ..."""" class=""""main"""">text and tags ...</div>""
Every double-quote is double-quoted a secound time. Additionally, the whole html-code is double-quoted.

The SaveAs.iim-Demo works, but there is no Data-Extraction involved.

Do you have an idea, how to solve the problem?

Now here are the problems i have with this script. 
FIrst of all the CSV file contains no formatting. There is no separation between the records making them much harder to analyze.
And the second problem is that each page in Yellowpages contains 30 records and I can only TAG 20 POS. After I get to 20 POSi get the following error Automatic POS detection failed (POS > 20). please try to specify the element further.

my questions are the following.
How can I make the macro format the CSV file so that I have one value in each line.
And is there any way aroun the 20 POS limitation.

Write data keeping column headings and order from datasource,"Hi
My iMacros works like a charme only for one given datasource file, but i want to rework the imacros to work with different datasource files.
Each of my datasource files has different amount and headings of columns: the one could have
Code: Select allberlin,hamburg
url1,url2 
another one could have
Code: Select allhamburg,munich,cologne
url3,url4,url5

The first question is:
 - How can i set the column amount of the datasource file dynamically, so i'm not forced to set up an exact amount like SET !DATASOURCE_COLUMNS 1? I want just say: imacros, take all data from the first column, than from the next, and then from the last one.

Then i do some extractions from given websites (which are in datasource files) and save extractings in another csv.
The second question is:
 - How is it possible to write data, like it is in the datasource: column headings, and the extractions?",1

SOLVED: Decode URL entities on extraction,"Hi
My iMacro takes URLs from a csv file, loads them into browser one by one, searchs a HTML element with defined CSS class and, on finding, extracts the content of the HTML element as HTML source code. Then it saves the extracted code together with the URL, where the finding originates from, into created csv file.

The problem is, that if i open extraction csv file in Excel or code editor, all extracted URLs are with encoded entities, like http_s://www.google.de/search?q=[b]g%C3%83%C2%BC ... bernachten[/b] . But i need to have decoded entities in the extracted URLs. Beside of this, it seems, like the csv file, created by iMacros, wouldn't be in UTF-8: i guess so, because after i decoded extracted URLs in the csv file with a VBA script directly in Excel, some entities, like space, were correctly decoded, but entities like german characters üöä, are broken like http_s://www.google.de/search?q=gÃƒÂ¼nstig ÃƒÂ¼bernachten

I was thinking about something like
Code: Select allSET !VAR2 decodeURIComponent ({{!URLCURRENT}}) 
ADD !EXTRACT {{!VAR2}}
or
Code: Select allSET !VAR2 unescape ({{!URLCURRENT}}) 
ADD !EXTRACT {{!VAR2}}
but this with some certainty don't work.
Would somebody point me to (quick and dirty) solution?

Simple image capture,"Hello all or whoever reads this.
 Let me start off by saying, I know absolutely NOTHING about programming. If this makes you laugh, I'm perfectly OK with that. If iMacros isn't even considered programming, that's fine too. I'm looking for help here, not someone to just quickly say what I need to do and then expect me to do it. I won't be able to do that on my own. So please accept my apologies in advance for not knowing what i probably should know and please except my gratitude for helping me out.  Here's what I'm looking for. I need a simple way to automate the downloads on this wallpapers page.

I'd preferably like to download all of them and have it save each category into it's own folder, ie. all the fantasy wallpapers in a fantasy folder, all the gaming ones in a gaming folder, and such. The main ones I've after are the gaming wallpapers though, so if that's all that can be done, then that's cool.

Handling two drop downs,"I've been trying to scrape up data from a web page which has two drop downs, Upon submission of drop down box - a table appears which i wanna scrape.

URL I've been trying to scrape is 

https://tseamcet.nic.in [Works only on Internet Explorer]

In the home page, you will see "" College-wise allotment Details"" - click on it and it will take you to a page with two drop downs. 

[The whole site is protected from some sort of security measures, which prevents direct accessing of allotment page via URL || Only way is through HOME PAGE and then COLLEGE WISE ALLOTMENTS DETAILS]

On that page, I wanna select a college from drop down and all branches from second drop down and extract table which appears upon clicking ""Show Allotments"".

Eg: Lets say college i wanna select is ""JNTH - JNTU COLLEGE OF ENGG. HYDERABAD, HYDERABAD"" and branch is  ""COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING"" from two drop downs, upon clicking Show Allotments, a table appears with list of students. I wanna be able to scrape that table with two more extra columns containing COLLEGE NAME and BRANCH. Next I wanna just change branch say ""ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING"", i wanna again click show allotments and scrape table again. I wanna continue this process for each branch for a college. Upon mismatch of branch with college, I wanna prevent scraping. To cut long story short, I wanna

1. Input College in first drop down
2. Input all the possible branches in second drop down
    i.   Click ""Show Allotments""
    ii.  Scrape table with two more columns containing COLLEGE NAME and BRANCH
    iii. Save Extracted Data in a table
3. Upon mismatch of College Name and branch, Prevent scraping

2. If there is an email address under Contact details, place it in a second column next to the name. Otherwise skip to the next entry.

Extract (horrible) paged table with AJAX using Javascript,"This is not a question topic, I just would like to share the solution I used to extract info from a page using iMacro FF plugin.
First - iMacro is a fantastic product! I don't need the paid suite so far but I ordered my company to buy it because I will need it sooner or later and it totally worths every penny.
Second - the amount of information in the forum, the tech support and the examples are also fantastic! I built a solution in 2 days from scratch by reading everyone's else issues and solution. That's why I want to share mine, hope it can help others.

The issue: I have to extract to csv all the entries from this website - https://www.compras.rj.gov.br/publico/ (which only works on IE - blergh!)
If you click on the right table on ""10775 concluidas"" it will show a table on the center with the 10775 Licitacoes I have to extract info from.

I used the User Agent Switcher add-on for FF (https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-br/firefo ... -switcher/) to pretend I was in IE. A great add-on, by the way. For some reason in my experience iMacro works better with FF than Chrome or IE, and it has the built-in support for scripting using javascript. So, FF is the way.

The information is based on a paged table with 10 entries per page. I need some info that is showed when I click on each link. The page was designed using Ajax and javascript, so when you click the link it shows the information I need on the same page and div. This wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that when you click the ""Retornar"" button on the bottom of each detailed page to go back to the previous page with the 10 entries, it always goes to the very FIRST 10 entries. Horrible! I would have to navigate to the correct page each time I finished my 10 entries extraction. I was able to build a solution like that looping through JS and iMacro, but it would take around 20 days with more than 10,000 entries. Not sure if the reason for that is clear, one would have to test th page to better understand. For example, I started in the page 1 (1-10 entries) and extract the 10 entries as desired. Then I increment a variable (k) to run a 'pagechange' iMacro so I could get to the page 2 (11-20 entries). Issue is - when I click the ""Retornar"" button from the detailed entry 11, it does not takes me to Page 2, it takes me to Page 1! So, for instnce, in page 500, after I extract the details from entry 501, the ""Retornar"" button would take me again to page 1 and I would have to run the iMacro 'pagechange' 500 times to get to entry 502...hope the issue is clear.

As I said I developed a first solution using this option that would take 20 days. I will share if someone wants because it can be useful for some loop with JS learning:    
Code: Select allvar macro;

var k=0;
for (var j=1;j<1078;j++) { ///loop pelo numero de paginas
	for (var i=1;i<20;i++)	{ ///loop pelo numero de registros da tabela de cada pagina
			if (k>0) { ///ajusta a paginacao porque o codigo sempre retorna para a primeira pagina
				for (var p=0;p<k;p++) { ///vai para a pagina da vez
					iimPlay(""pagechange"");
				}
			}
		iimSet(""i"",i)
		iimPlay(macro)
		i = i+1
			if (i==20) {
				k++;
		}
	}
}


The final solution: I used the Firebug add-on to find out how the paging was being handled. It turns out to be a javascript function with 3 parameters. Then I used the command URL GOTO in iMacro to go to the correct page each time I needed, using a variable to loop through the top entry of each page. Below is the final solution, not sure if there's an easier or more straigth forward solution for this site. I know this one is working great and I hope it can be useful for someone with similar pages to scrape. In the end I successfully scraped the 10775 in a couple of hours.
Code: Select allvar macro;
macro =""CODE:"";

macro +=""SET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO""+""\n"";

                iimSet(""k"",k)
		iimSet(""i"",i)
		iimPlay(macro)
		i = i+1
			if (i==20) {
				k=k+10;
		}
	}
}



I also did a rewing solution to scrape from the start to end, so I could finish it sooner. The rewind starts k with 10760 to go to the last page with 10 entries and the subtracts 10 on each loop:
Code: Select allvar macro;
macro =""CODE:"";

var k=10760;
for (var j=1;j<1078;j++) { ///loop pelo numero de paginas
	for (var i=1;i<20;i++)	{ ///loop pelo numero de registros da tabela de cada pagina
                iimSet(""k"",k)
		iimSet(""i"",i)
		iimPlay(macro)
		i = i+1
			if (i==20) {
				k=k-10;
		}
	}
}

*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

How to go through a list in a changing website!,"Hi! I am so new in the world of programming, that I am frustrated because I don't even know where to look and learn, so any advice is helpful here. . I am working.

If we have it I have to click on ""send report"" then a new window pops up, I have to click a new link to send a fax to the primary care doctor and send a report to the primary doctor. If the number has ""-"", ""/"" or anything else I have to erase them, then click send. After that, I have to do the same for each patient.  I have to do this hundreds of times a day.

iMacros stopped working message,"iMacros 10.3 / IE 11 / Windows 7 / Language: English

I have a macro that uses iMacros to scrape information off of an invoice.  This macro worked in iMacros 6.9 and 9.  When we went to version 10 and 10.3, I've started encountering an issue.  The macro will go through 2, 3, 4, 5, or more invoices and a message is displayed that says ""iMacros has stopped working.  A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.  Please close the program."" A button is displayed that says ""Close the program"".  There is no other information to determine what the problem is or how to fix it.

The macro loops through a series of invoices.  After it extracts the appropriate information, the clicks on an ""X"" to close the invoice.  It them checks to see if that the application is on the correct screen.  If so, it moves to the invoice search screen and starts over.  The problem seems to occur after clicking on the ""X"" top close the invoice.

This is the code that closes the invoice (clicks on the ""X""):

IM = """"
IM = ""CODE:""
IM = IM + ""TAB T=1"" + vbNewLine
IM = IM + ""TAB CLOSEALLOTHERS"" + vbNewLine
IM = IM + ""FRAME NAME=container"" + vbNewLine

IM = IM + ""TAG POS=1 TYPE=BUTTON FORM=NAME:pageForm ATTR=NAME:Close"" + vbNewLine
IM = IM + ""WAIT SECONDS=2"" + vbNewLine

iret = iim1.iimPlay(IM)

I've also used the following FRAME NAMES to see if that would make a difference and it doesn't.

IM = IM + ""FRAME F=3"" + vbNewLine
IM = IM + ""FRAME NAME=*"" + vbNewLine


This is the code that moves to the invoice search screen by click on a tab in the application and selecting the appropriate option:

Extracting Tooltip from Onmouseover,"Hello fellow iMacros(u)sers  

So far I've had lots of fun and great success with iMacros. However I seemed to have reached my limit of programming capability with this one particular case.   

I've been trying to extract a Tooltip triggered by a mouseover event. I found the entire passage in the source code, so it's definitely exctractable right away, if anything I found out that iMacros has a feature to now trigger mouse events, but I didn't even get that far. I always hover over the respective thing on the website myself, just to see if iMacros will pick it up, but I'm not getting there.

The Code I'm trying to break, I changed the values a little bit.
(Note that whatever text I'm trying to extract appears twice, they are both the same and extracting one of them is enough for me.)

I am trying to read the Tips basically. I know how to crop them and replace whatever I don't need, I also know how to extract the 2.966.578 part, I just can't seem to get the Tooltip. 
I've had various tries, here are my last ones, including some thing I found on the forums here and tried out. 
Code: Select all//iimPlayCode(""TAG POS=2 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:storageLevel&&ONMOUSEOVER:Tip EXTRACT=TXT"");
	//iimPlayCode(""TAG POS=1 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:onmouseover* EXTRACT=TXT"");
	//iimPlayCode(""TAG POS=7 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:c73w:storageLevel&&ONMOUSEOVER:Tip EXTRACT=TXT"");
	//iimPlayCode(""TAG POS=7 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:c73w CONTENT=EVENT:MOUSEOVER EXTRACT=TXT"");
	//iimPlayCode(""TAG POS=7 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:c73w:storageLevel&&ONMOUSEOVER:Tip EXTRACT=TXT"");


This I also found on the forums here, but building it into above TAGs always gives me an error claiming it was a wrong use of Command:Tag
Code: Select all	//CONTENT=EVENT:MOUSEOVER


I would really appreciate if anyone could help me out there, how do I extract the Tip?
Thank you for your time and help!

Beginner [HELP NEEDED],"Hello everyone...

i'm new to imacros and i'm not a developer at all. i just finished reading the iMacros command refference, but i'm needing some hints to develop some data extraction macro.

the issue that i'm frontin is that, bc i'm no developer i dont have the agility to think on every variable to use in the code. so what im asking is if can anyone help me, pointing the way? like you should read this or that. i'm not looking for completed codes. i want to get there myself in order to learn.

so, i would like to code a macro, that goes to a URL, and in that url there are several links. i need the macro to open a link at a time, and in the new page, extract the data needed. then i need it to loop until there is no more links available to enter.

i dont know if im being clear enough, but at this point any help is a blessing!

thanks in advance..

Cheers

Comparing Data Between Two Spreadsheets?,"Hello people. I love iMacros and know there has got to be a way to use it to do what need to do at work.

Save URL to file with parameters,"Hi,

I just started using iMacro so maybe for the experts this might be simple.
But after I checked the forum for similar issues without success I try to find help here.

So, currently I use the iMacro Addon in Firefox and start it like this

Run, %firefoxExePath% %url% %iMacro% from AHK

there the iMakro looks like this

VERSION  BUILD=7500718 RECORDER=FX

SET !VAR1 {{!URLCURRENT}}
SET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO
TAB T=1     
WAIT SECONDS=3
URL GOTO={{!VAR1}}
SAVEAS TYPE=HTM FOLDER=C:\Workspace\Downloads FILE=temp1.htm

That works fine, but I have some questions.

1. Is it possible to pass parameters to the macro for the folder and the file?
So I would like to do something like

SAVEAS TYPE=HTM FOLDER={{!VAR2}} FILE={{!VAR3}}

2. If the filename or foldername include spaces I recognized some problems. Is theere a way to use spaces in the parameters?

Thanks in advance!

Kind regards

Number of concurrent Browsers,"Hello all, 

I'm running iMacros from WSH and JScript.  I have manually been launching the scripts.  Each scraping script takes a long time to complete (10 hours +). In the documentation, if I remember correctly, it says that AlertFox was able to run 25 browsers concurrently with 2 gigs of Ram and an average processor.  Im not coming anywhere close to that.  

I'm running windows server 2008 R2 with 2Gb Ram and a dual core 2.44Ghz processor (AMD).  If I run 4 scripts at once, I'm at like 80 CPU usage and 60% RAM usage immediately.

Am I doing something wrong here?  What do other people acheive? Any tips on getting either of those number down?  

Thanks,

SET command not working in under JavaScript when extracting,"Hello everyone,

At the company I'm working, we're (trying) to build an authomatic data extractor but it fails and I can't see a way to solve it.
It takes out information (the latest ID which is displayed in main page in our internal web application) and we need to store that information later on a third-party website (and we are not allowed to use any API from them)

We want to use the latest ID as the source for a loop in Javascript.
Once we open our web app the information shown is the latest customer order information (ie: 32000)

When I test the macro code without JavaScript it works but if I am planning to do it this way inside a Javascript file, it comes with an error.
wrong format of SET command, line 6 (Error code: 910)

Javascript file was done in NotePad (UTF-8), right now it is stored inside iMacros\Macros Folder (Same directory as samples)

I want to do that number as a variable for the loop (which I can't use it yet because it's failing)

I know the for loop is wrong at the moment but I cannot understand why a simple line works fine when I run it as iim file and when I try to use it inside JavaScript, it fails.

Saving TYPE=EXTRACT as CSV...with Commas?,"Hello All,

Needless to say, the software is saving me a lot of time.

I've read the documentation on loading data into webforms and extracting text from the output; very straightforward.

Sorry if it's messy. Here's a link to the macro: https://www.dropbox.com/s/stsltfvph2zr4bn/IAPD.iim?dl=0 and the dataset I am plugging into the webform:https://www.dropbox.com/s/mmu6y13d3or9n ... s.csv?dl=0.

Basically, the extract .csv file is unable to preserve punctuation (commas) in an investment firm's name because the file is, of course, comma-separated. Here https://www.dropbox.com/s/h9ro8igxcxnfy ... t.csv?dl=0 is a link to the extract.

I need to merge this database with another and it is really really imperative that I keep the output identical to what comes out on the webpage, including punctuation, spaces, capitalization, acute accents...etc.

Has anyone been able to do this? Would setting EXTRACT to some other type of formatting potentially preserve punctuation?

Any and all advice would be greatly greatly appreciated. Thank you!",4
extral data been extract from table,"Here is the html page looks like

IE 11 / iMacros 10.0.2.2823 - iMacros stopped working,"I have a macro using (Excel VBA) that goes through out invoice application. The macro opens an invoice and extracts information on a number of different screens. It then closes the invoice, looks for the word ""reservation"" on the next screen. Once it finds ""reservation, it should open the next ticket. 

With IE 8 / iMacros 9, the macro did not encounter any issue. However, recently, we were upgraded to IE 11 and iMacros 10. When users run the macro now, they can get a ""iMacros has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Please close the program."" message.  Sometimes it will go through 10 tickets before it displays the message while other times it will go through 3 tickets.  It's not consistent.

Following is the loop where the macro is looking for the word ""reservation"". this appears to be the place where the error / problem occurs.
lCnt = 0
vpagehead = """"

Do Until InStr(1, vpagehead1, ""Reservation Number"") > 0 Or InStr(1, vpagehead1, ""servation:"") > 0 Or lCnt = 25

    iret = iim1.iimPlay(IM)

Does anyone see any reason why this code would cause an issue that would cause iMacros to close?

Important Progress iMacros Product Update,"Dear iMacros Customers and Users, 

We are writing to inform you that Progress will be officially discontinuing the Progress iMacros product, with a planned End-Of-Life date of November 30, 2023. 

What does this mean? 
Moving forward, Progress will continue to support the iMacros product and will only provide critical fixes as needed until the EOL date. We will honor all service agreements through the existing term, except for those contracts that go beyond the EOL date. Customers with service agreements that go beyond the EOL date will be contacted separately to discuss their options and next steps. We will continue to offer service agreement renewals that do not exceed the EOL date. 

What are your next steps? 
Please remain on the lookout for more communications from Progress in the coming months, as more information will be made readily available to assist you as you prepare your transition plans. 

If you have additional questions, please email iMacrosInquiries@progress.com 

On behalf of Progress, thank you for your continued partnership and commitment. 

Sincerely,  
The Progress iMacros Team",2
*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

Download as Excel file from drop down option,"Hi,

I am not very familiar with iMacros (or even HTML), and got to know about it as an easier way (compared to writing a JavaScript code) for web scraping. I know my coding skills are very minimal, but I am very close to finding a solution to my data scraping needs using iMacros. I would really appreciate if this forum could provide a workable solution to the issue I am facing (advance apologies for technical imprecision):

First of all, I am using iMacros version 881205 with Firefox v 34.0.5 on Windows 7. I need to download data from a website such that I have to select (click on) Level A, which leads to Level B, clicking on which leads to Level C, which contains the required data (table). iMacros works perfectly for going back and forth between different levels, but I am facing trouble with saving the table, for which there is an option to download it as Excel (or PDF) from a drop down.

The actual trouble is not so much for downloading the table as Excel, as iMacros records that step as well:

TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=ID:ReportViewer_ctl05_ctl04_ctl00_ButtonLink
TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:Excel
TAB T=2
TAB T=1

(i did find a similar post http://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php? ... 742#p61655, but unfortunately it didn't provide a solution to my problem)

The problem occurs when it takes time to load the page (at Level C), the code gets stuck and shows error that TAB T = 2 does not exist. I guess this happens because when one clicks at the option to save as Excel, the browser opens a new tab (finding a way around this issue might as well solve my problem), and then closes it and returns to the original tab. 

To get over this issue, I have included WAIT SECONDS = 5 (or even a higher number) before this step, but sometimes when it takes longer than the specified number of seconds for a page to load, the whole thing just stops. Also, this is not a very efficient solution as I am making the program wait every time even when the page has loaded, and when the page actually takes time to load, this does not provide any help.

I also tried WAIT SECONDS = (10 | #DOWNLOADCOMPLETES) but it does not work. I have increased !TIMEOUT_PAGE and have SET !ERRORIGNORE YES.

The way I see it, I believe a possible solution could be to somehow avoid the TAB = 2 TAB = 1 steps altogether (?), or to write an IF condition for the code to enter TAB = 2 only when the page has loaded completely (?).

As I mentioned above, my coding skills are very limited and maybe not up to the task. So, I hope this forum can provide some solution to my problem. Also, please do tell if there is no way to go around this issue using iMacros so that I may look for some other way to scrape the data (please suggest); or, if nothing works out, will have to get on with manually downloading the data (which would be a shame i suppose ).

Sorry for the longish post (better technical understanding may have reduced the length). I really appreciate your time and effort.",3

How many posts per page?,"Hallo,

I would like to extract text from a web page.

Extracting returns empty data,"Hello, I am using iMacros on the js script.
Using Tag with Extract=txt in a loop.
The first extract is always successfull, but all the next ones are empty.
Sample code:
Code: Select all
// the {{t}} is the loop variable

iimPlay(""CODE: TAG POS={{t}} TYPE=DIV ATTR=CLASS:someclass EXTRACT=TXT"");

var s = iimGetLastExtract();

// alert(s); - this way I check the value

if (s == ""something"")
{

iimPlay(""CODE:TAG POS={{t}} TYPE=IMG ATTR=CLASS:Image&&SRC:http://image.gif""); // follow a linked image - not ""clicking"" either

//iimPlay(""CODE: SET !EXTRACT NULL""); - doesnt matter if I put it here or not, the next value always returns empty (unless I put it before first extract, then it returns correct value. Weird thing is that, the first extract gives empty data if I put it at the script beginning

iimPlay(""CODE: TAG POS={{t}} TYPE=DIV ATTR=CLASS:divclass EXTRACT=TXT"");

looping through two recordsources,"Hello, I'm relatively new to iMacros and javascript, but not to programming...

First off, I'm running iMacros version 8.8.2
                                Firefox version 24
                           On Windows Xp Pro Ver 5.1 with service pack 3

heres what i need to be able to do:
open my first recordsource, loop through the data(.csv file), each record is an url that i want to goto,
then, open my second recordset, loop through each record and update the first recordset, based on what i have in the second...


here is what i've got so far......

var numberOfUrls = 1001
while(true){
for(var i=1;i<numberOfUrls;i++){
var macro = ""CODE: ""
macro+= ""SET !ERRORIGNORE YES""+""\n""
macro+= ""SET !REPLAYSPEED fast""+""\n""
macro+= ""SET !TIMEOUT_STEP 1""+""\n""
macro+= ""SET !DATASOURCE Grp1000USA.csv""+""\n""
macro+= ""SET !LOOP ""+i+""\n""
macro+= ""SET !DATASOURCE_LINE {{!LOOP}}""+""\n""
macro+= ""URL GOTO={{!COL1}}""+""\n""

the above works fine I can go to the url in column 1 and even manipulate the data there. 
But, what I need to be able to do is now open a second recordset and loop though all the records(1 per line) and update the first url, with col2 from the second recourd source
Heres my first problem, I cant seem to pass the value of !COL2 from the macro to the script

macro+= ""!VAR1={{!COL2}}""+""\n""	

iimPlay(macro)

//mycode =!VAR1

mycode=iimGetLastExtract()

window.alert(mycode)


	Then here instead of adding a single piece of data then looping on through the original first datasource, I need to be able to loop through the second data source and update each record in first datasource with any info in the COL i need to use


//macro+= ""TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:mytext""+""\n""
//macro+= ""TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=ACTION:group.php ATTR=NAME:myname CONTENT={{!VAR1}}""+""\n""
//macro+= ""TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:SUBMIT FORM=ACTION:group.php ATTR=NAME:action&&VALUE:Invite""+""\n""

Fitness Center
Club House

The Problem I'm having is that each individual bullet point is extracting to its own separate row.

I want them to extract to a single column if possible, if not possible, multiple columns will work. 

As it is now the UL is messing up the rest of my extracted csv.

I haven't used li because the number of items changes depending on the page, and I'm still ignorant of some of the intermediate features like relative positioning, in addition there were no additional attributes I saw I could use after inspection of the source page and the element in particular using firefox or imacros browser.

I can see now though that when I inspect the element using IE I see <li abp=""1018>Fitness Center</li> etc. Maybe I could use that abp to get this taken care of.

Any help on this matter would be appreciated.

I'm doing most of this using Imacros browser but I can use Firefox or IE if I need to.

I hope I have made sense and that the provided example page helps. I appreciate the help I receive, and if I can provide more information let me know!

This is giving me a csv file as

def, 132.50, 1.50%
ghi, 24.35, -0.96%

the file name is having the timestamp.

What I want to know is there a possibility of getting the csv file contents to be as follows:
271014_1052, abc, 71.05, 3.00%
271014_1052, def, 132.50, 1.50%

Extracting from table not working correctly,"Hi,

I am using IE 8.0.6001.18702 on Windows XP SP 3, and iMacros for IE8 Version 10.2.26.4235

I am trying to extract the table data into a csv file as per below code

VERSION BUILD=10.2.26.4235
TAB T=1
TAB CLOSEALLOTHERS
URL GOTO=http://www.nseindia.com/live_market/dyn ... .htm?cat=O
TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=ID:tab8Content EXTRACT=TXT

Unfortunately, the output is not coming with the columns separated correctly --- especially since some of the column values also has a comma in it.

Have tried various combinations including 
TAG POS=1 TYPE=TABLE ATTR=TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT
which is giving correct column breakup but no values !!


Any help is appreciated. Thanks.",2
Loop through dynamically created pages (bttn click + scrape),"Dear all,

I have been recently started using iMacros for scraping webpages dynamically created.

The following code works for the first table I am interested in. What it does is to:
(1) click two buttons;
(2) extract the table
Code: Select all
VERSION BUILD=10022823
TAB T=1
URL GOTO=http://admitere.edu.ro/2010/staticRepI/j/
SIZE X=872 Y=527
WAIT SECONDS=0.5

'Click ""button 1""
DS CMD=CLICK X=223 Y=314 CONTENT=
WAIT SECONDS=0.5
'Click ""button 2""
DS CMD=CLICK X=421 Y=259 CONTENT=
WAIT SECONDS=0

'Scrape table 1
FRAME NAME=judete
TAG POS=1 TYPE=TABLE ATTR=CLASS:*mainTable* EXTRACT=TXT
WAIT SECONDS=0.5

'Save as csv
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=* FILE=table_1.csv



So far so good. Now what I would like to do is to click a third button (""button 3"") that would - again dynamically - create the next table, and scrape it. 
To this aim, I tried to add the following lines of code to the previous ones:
Code: Select all'Click ""button 3""
DS CMD=CLICK X=312 Y=172 CONTENT=
WAIT SECONDS=3

'Scrape table 2
FRAME NAME=judete
TAG POS=1 TYPE=TABLE ATTR=CLASS:*mainTable* EXTRACT=TXT
WAIT SECONDS=0.5

But unfortunately the first table is not updated as button 3 is not clicked (i.e. I scrape, again, the first table).
The strange thing is that if I repeat all the above passages without extracting the first table, then ""button 3"" is correctly clicked and the second table is scraped as expected:
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=10022823
TAB T=1
URL GOTO=http://admitere.edu.ro/2010/staticRepI/j/
SIZE X=872 Y=527
WAIT SECONDS=0.5

'Click ""button 1""
DS CMD=CLICK X=223 Y=314 CONTENT=
WAIT SECONDS=0.5
'Click ""button 2""
DS CMD=CLICK X=421 Y=259 CONTENT=
WAIT SECONDS=0
'Click ""button 3""
DS CMD=CLICK X=312 Y=172 CONTENT=
WAIT SECONDS=3

'Scrape table 2
FRAME NAME=judete
TAG POS=1 TYPE=TABLE ATTR=CLASS:*mainTable* EXTRACT=TXT
WAIT SECONDS=0.5

'Save as csv
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=* FILE=table_1.csv


In other words, the previous code clicks the three buttons and scrapes the second table, but if I try to scrape also the first one (before clicking button 3) then button 3 is not clicked so that table 2 is not scraped.

Could anyone explain to me the reason of what's happening? I am clearly missing some basic crucial step here.. 
Maybe the reason is that I cannot extract more than element at time? (meaning that I have to embed the code in a, e.g., VB loop script)

My final goal is to scrape the first, say, 10 tables.
That is, ideally I would like to keep clicking button 3 and scraping tables by implementing a loop.
Thank you very much for any suggestions.",6
Cancel IE Post-Download box,"Hello all,

first I would like to thank chivracq for what I've leanrt so far.

I'm pretty sure this issue is damn easy, but it's been 2 days and I starting being quite frustrated 

First of all:
Windows 7
IE9.0.20 (8112.16421)
iMacro V10.1.25.8883

I am trying to download multiple files.
But after the first download, iMacro waits 60s until it stops. Files are rather small, and take no time to download.
I also tried the Demo-download Macro, and the issue is similar, I don't reach the last webpage as the macro waits, once the download is finished.
If I click any of the button on the box IE pops once download is over, suggesting me to Open the file, the folder, or just cancel, the macro will go on.

I am pretty sure it is easy, but I can't figure it out...
Thank you,
Emile.

Problematic PDF Downloads,"CIM
Imacros version 101258883
Windows 8.1 English
Imacros browser

As with many of the websites I use I cannot reveal the login data or source.

I'm trying to download a PDF, but of course these is no link to the PDF, and it appears that there is no way to get the URL of the PDF because the link seems to be dynamically generated.

I would think this was a somewhat common issue.

I read the thread found here: http://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=2355

It basically says you might automate the download by preventing the browser from opening the PDF. But after attempting to follow the instructions (they are somewhat outdated), and researching on my own how to disable a PDF from opening in a browser, the pesky PDF still loads in the browser.

Has anyone figured out how to deal with this problem or similar? Thanks for your time.

If I could get just automate key strokes I could simply Ctrl+Shift+S to save the pdf from the browser, but that is not supported is it?

Thanks for your time.",6

Problem with encoding when using SAVEAS command,"I am using iMacros 8 and Internet Explorer 9.

I have a macro that downloads trademark data from the Belarus trademark office website. Each fetched trademark is saved as a complete web page and all downloaded marks are post processed by an other program to extract all relevant trademark data.

Recently the site lay-out was changed: the previous version of the page contained the header <META content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=Content-Type> which resulted automaticaly in a saved html file of type U8-DOS where all Cyrillic characters where maintained.
The new version now contains the header <META content=""text/html; charset=windows-1251"" http-equiv=Content-Type> which results in a saved file of type DOS where all Cyrillic characters are malformed.
When saving the page manually with Internet Explorer you can switch the encoding from Cyrillic (Windows) to Unicode (UTF-8) to resolve this problem.
Any ideas how to accomplish the same result with iMacros?

Extract content based on its proximity to a located image,"Hi.

I had a search through ther forum but i may not be able to search correctly for what i am looking for so please forgive me if this has ben asked before.

I am planning to use the find image on page function to identify the x and y location of the image. I then want to extract any text which is within a specific pixel distance from the image. or possibly just in the div above and the div below 

however this seems to have its own set of issues as the CSS may make a div appear in a different place than its location within the raw html.

hence i have turned to imacros.

So question is can i specify to extract text from within a certain area of the page ?",4

Extracting always returns #EANF# with IE plugin (even demos),"Hi,

Got a strange situation with the latest IE plugin, on a windows 7 system with IE 8 (can't upgrade due to compatibility reasons with certain applications)

The macro keeps returning #EANF# when trying to extract text or html from a website ... it's not an issue with my macro as the included extract demo also keeps giving the #EANF#.
We have another system, also running windows 7 with the exact same version of IE 8 and also latest version of the imacros IE plugin (downloaded from this site a couple days ago) ... and on that system it works without a problem.

Does anybody have any idea what could cause this?
Could it be a certain security setting in IE that prevents the imacros IE plugin from extracting data?

Need help with loop for js,"Hi.
Iam from Germany, so sorry for my bad english. 
On a website, i want to click 50 links. After each click extract a few values, go back, and klick the next one.
After this go to the next page and begin again ...
The first macro is this (erbuy.iim) :
Code: Select allSET !ERRORIGNORE YES
SET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP no
SET !VAR1 {{!LOOP}}
ADD !VAR1 

TAG POS={{!VAR1}} TYPE=A ATTR=CLASS:productConversion*
TAG POS=R1 TYPE=A ATTR=HREF:*

TAG POS=1 TYPE=LI ATTR=class:price&&TXT:Preis* EXTRACT=TXT
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=C:\Dokumente<SP>und<SP>Einstellungen\blub\Desktop\Macros\ FILE=erbuy-auslesen.csv
BACK

When i set up the repetitions on firefox to 50, it works fine.
Than the next macor should start (erbuy-weiter.iim) :
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:weiter

I create a js file (erbuy-java.js)
Code: Select alliimPlay(""\erbuy.iim""); 
iimPlay(""\erbuy-weiter.iim""); 

It works, but because the first script starts every time at the beginning, it only extracted TAG POS=1.
So i tried something like this ( a part of the code )
Code: Select allvar jsNewLine=""\n""
var MyMacroCode

MyMacroCode = ""CODE:""
MyMacroCode = MyMacroCode+""SET !VAR1 {{!LOOP}}"" + jsNewLine
MyMacroCode = MyMacroCode+""ADD !VAR1 "" + jsNewLine
MyMacroCode = MyMacroCode+""TAG POS={{!VAR1}} TYPE=A ATTR=CLASS:productConversion*"" + jsNewLine
iimPlay(MyMacroCode)
 

That doesent work. I think i have read that js can not handle commands with {{!}}.

Now i dont know what to do next. Hope anyone can help me to find a solution.",4

Is there a way to dump also the #EANF# when tags not found i,"Hi,

I am facing this issue in version 7 imacro not in 6.

When I am trying extract few tags from a website, I see that #EANF# is not saved in the output file when tags are not found. This was not the case in earlier version.

This is breaking the column definition that is built into my automation. Number of values in a row keeps changing based on the tags found. But what I need is to have #EANF# for non found tags so that my columns in the output file are fixed and known.

Is there a way to dump also the #EANF# when tags not found in version 7? 
Your help is greatly appreciated.

Important Progress iMacros Product Update,"Dear iMacros Customers and Users, 

We are writing to inform you that Progress will be officially discontinuing the Progress iMacros product, with a planned End-Of-Life date of November 30, 2023. 

What does this mean? 
Moving forward, Progress will continue to support the iMacros product and will only provide critical fixes as needed until the EOL date. We will honor all service agreements through the existing term, except for those contracts that go beyond the EOL date. Customers with service agreements that go beyond the EOL date will be contacted separately to discuss their options and next steps. We will continue to offer service agreement renewals that do not exceed the EOL date. 

What are your next steps? 
Please remain on the lookout for more communications from Progress in the coming months, as more information will be made readily available to assist you as you prepare your transition plans. 

If you have additional questions, please email iMacrosInquiries@progress.com 

On behalf of Progress, thank you for your continued partnership and commitment. 

Sincerely,  
The Progress iMacros Team",2
*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

How to extract the downloadable CSV-files from Google Trends,"Dear Community,

I am new to iMacro and did not find any helpful topics existing so far that could help me with my problem: For a research project we need to extract the CSV-Files that are available at Google Trends (www.google.com/trends/explore) for each combination of country and search term about a hundred times. I recorded the downloading process (you need to be logged in to gmail to download the CSV-files) with iMacros and chose the option ""open file"" (otherwise it will just rewrite the file every single time, because every CSV-file has the same name and I do not know how to rename it during iMacro's downloading process). However, when I replay the Macro I recorded, nothing happens. The macro gets stuck whenever it arrives at the first ONDOWNLOAD command. The error name is the following: ""RuntimeError: ONDOWNLOAD command was used but no download occurred. (Error code: -804)"".

Does anyone know how it is possible to download the CSV-files from the Google Trends website and then either open or save it?

Thanks a lot in advance for your help

Anchor Point Problem,"I have been impressed with IMacros, and have written a couple of macros that work very well.  My problem is that I appear to have an anchor point problem that results in me getting the subsequent EXTRACT - not the one I am expecting.  The relevant information is as follows:

My expectation is that the above code would set the extraction point at ""result"", and the EXTRACT=HREF would pick up the immediately following URL (e.g., LOOP=1 would return ""50th parallel"" URL and LOOP 2 the ""Terravista Fandango"" link.  Unfortunately LOOP 1 returns the ""Terravista Fandango"" link and LOOP 2 returns the URL pointing to the third result.

Would appreciate any help that one could provide...

Trouble Exporting from a Website,"Hello all,

     I've been using a iMacros to scrape a web table of times entered for quite some time now. The company has redesigned their page and now I'm having a lot of trouble getting iMacros to pull the data. The site is password protected so I will try and provide as much relevant information as possible. 

The site is a .aspx site and I've included a screenshot of the page for visual reference. The source code is quite long and I've added the <div> and <table> that my data is located in to the bottom of this post. I've put the data I want to extract in bold

I have been working with iMacros for Firefox and when trying to manually use the Extract command and locate the table with the TAG POS command and TYPE=TABLE, I can't find the data. Or rather I've tried up to POS=10 and I haven't gone far enough. In order to avoid blindly picking positions, I downloaded Firefox for IE to use the Table Extraction Wizard. When I click on my table the preview window shows that it has found my data and creates the command:

TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV FORM=ID:aspnetForm ATTR=ID:ct100_cphMain_gvDaily_GridData EXTRACT=TXT

I manually added:
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=* FILE=test.csv

Use Conditional Eval for URL GOTO,"First, I know how to do this in javascript... but for this macro IT MUST be an EVAL statement - No Javascript - Running it from the iMacros browser.  

I'm simply extracting the variable in the URL and depending on what that value is I want the next thing the macro does - simply go to a URL

EXAMPLE:  http://beatlemaniac.com/t=Ringo
Code: Select allSET !VAR1 EVAL(""var x = '{{!URLCURRENT}}'.match(/t=(.+)/); x[1];"")


If t=Ringo URL GOTO=xxxx.com
if t=George URL GOTO=aaaa.com
if t=John URL GOTO=bbbb.com
if t=Paul URL GOTO=cccc.com

It's that simple.  Any suggestions - It's driving me crazy.  TIA.",2

Generic iMacros to fetch from multiple Websites,"Hi All,

I am newbie to iMacros but i found the tool very useful. I bought iMacros Scripting Edition some days ago.

I need your suggestion in achieving one requirement
Requirement : Need to fetch job ads from many websites
Question : Can i write a generic iMacro to fetch data from multiple websites??

I am using VBA to fetch the data and i use iimGetLastExtract() API to get the whole table that has ads. But problem i am facing here is once i fetch the data, i need to parse, but for each website i need to parse differently. In one website i got #Next# and #Newline# where Tag Element was TABLE but in other website it is DIV, where i didn't get these separators.

Please suggest me how do i carry this task.

I can't keep on recording iMacros for 1000 websites and writing each function for each website. Can i get some logic??

Hoping to get reply soon.

Thanks,
Arun",6
LOOP to Next Loop when error is reached?,"hello...

i am relatively new to imacros and looking to scrape some data. i have a working script but would like to make one modification to it. the basic idea of the script is that it scrapes data from the 10 results from a search page on a site, then proceeds to page two to of the results. i am using the {{!LOOP}} command to go through a list of URLs i would like to scrape. however, some search results only have 1 or two pages of results, while others have 20+ pages. 

the way the current script is written, when the tag is no longer found on the page it continues to run when i would like it to stop for the current loop and move on to the next.

so i really have a two part question.

1. is there a way to tell the script to go to the next LOOP when an error is reached? if so, how?
2. what is the best way to scrape through multiple pages of search results? right now (as you will see in the code below) i simply copy the code over again and paste it below so it runs again on page 2 of the search results. surely, there has to be a better way to do this? (i am by no means a coder, just hacked some stuff together to get it to sort of work how i want it to - so any help is appreciated!)

Extract specific URLs,"Hello everyone, I hope you're doing well and thanks for reading my post. I'm not a total newbie to iMacros,and I've created a couple of simple imacro scripts in the past. Anyway now I face a task which I find beyond the scope of my abilities. I need to scrape urls from a certain page, but I only need to scrape the ones which have not been opened before. So the ones which are not present in the history, or the ones which are blue in color and not purple. 

The first way is very difficult, as many guys I've read say that you cannot browse your history with a script because of a privacy issue. So now I've turnt my head to the second solution. I need to find a way to firstly extract the color from the text and then to decide if it should be extracted or not. 

Any ideas or suggestions?

Thanks in advance, and kind regards.",8

Extracting data with same POS?,"Hi I've always wondered how would I extract text if the text is a variable but has the same POS as a different text which is constant in every email. e.g.

TAG POS=3 TYPE=TD ATTR=TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT
SET !VAR1 {{!EXTRACT}}
TAG POS=3 TYPE=TD ATTR=TXT:To<SP>verify<SP>your<SP>email<SP>and<SP>receive<SP>your<SP>f*

As you can see the last line as the same POS as the 4th line and when i try extract the text using that code all i get is a bunch of lines with no text as you can see here: 















The text it is trying to extract (TAG POS=3 TYPE=TD ATTR=TXT:UZHWCL7T) always varies from email to email, it is always capitals and sometimes has random numbers, but it is always the same amount of characters.

Data Extraction and Use of Tabs [HELP] Firefox,"My first problem is that I use imacro to fill out forms on websites.
However, this specific website however obviously saves cookies and if I try fill out the form twice it'll tell me that I have already done it and I have to come back tomorrow, however if I use a private window I can do it as many times as I want as long as I manually close the window open a new private window and then start the macro again..

I was wondering isit possible to somehow get this macro to loop without having to always babysit it..
I have seen other people do this with the new skittles thing but they wont spill the beans on how they do it.. This guy shows most of his code if you want to take a look at it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNAJ-BU3dt0 (its the tab on the left I'm interested in)

split text  and paste in diferent fields,"Hello,

I need to fill a lot of Multiple Choice Questions with the answers into a form, and trying to work with iMacros, but I'm at the very beginning.

I just figured out how to get a loop that aks for copying the questions and answers and how to fill sth. in the different fields:
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=8810214 RECORDER=FX

TAG POS={{!LOOP}} TYPE=INPUT:TEXT ATTR=ID:answer4 CONTENT=dd
TAG POS={{!LOOP}} TYPE=INPUT:TEXT ATTR=ID:answer5 CONTENT=dd
TAG POS={{!LOOP}} TYPE=BUTTON ATTR=ID:addQuestionButton

the questions are like this:
Welche Aussagen zu Virusinfektionen in der Schwangerschaft treffen nicht zu?
a) Für die Abschätzung des Risikos einer Gefährdung von Embryo oder Fetus sind die
lmpfanamnese‚ das Schwangerschaftsalter und der Serostatus der Schwangeren von Bedeutung.
b) Voraussetzung für eine embryonale oder fetale Infektion ist die Infektion der Schwangeren mit
Virämie.
c) Eine ClVIV-Infektion stellt für Frühgeborene eine größere Bedrohung dar als für Babys, die zum
Termin geboren wurden.
d) Das Risiko einer Rötelnembryopathie nimmt in den ersten 14 Gestationswochen stark ab.
e) Von Impfungen in der Schwangerschaft ist grundsätzlich abzuraten.

so there is the question with a diferent amount of lines and the answers, always starting with a), b), c).... or A), B), C)

what I need now, is to put everything in the corresponding field. Anyone has an idea?
Mine was to split the text from the clipboard to lines and put every line, that starts with ""a)"" or ""A)"" into answer 1 and so on, and leaving the rest for the question.
But as I said, I have no clue how to do it, so maybe someone can help me?

I hope I made clear what i need.

Thank you in advance

Export from page to web form,"Hi guys, I'm new here and just started looking into iMacros for firefox. Maybe what I am looking for is not available in this version, but if so, any help would be appreciated.

My question is, is it possible to take certain elements from one site's page (values, such as name, address, phone number, etc) and use that information to fill out a form on a different site, into their respective fields. Then go back to the first, pull up the next page with different info, but of the same type, and use it to automatically fill out the form on the second site in the same fashion.

If this is at all possible, please let me know, even if I can only do it for only one specific page to another, would be very helpful. If this functionality is not there by default but can be added, any pointers would be much appreciated. 

I appreciate your time and consideration.

If I have not able to communicate clearly, this example should show exactly what i am looking for:

page on site 123.com
(static content)

NAME:
Billy

PHONE #:
222-4444

ADDRESS:
554 W Main street

So, I want to be able to automatically export this information as follows:

page on differentsiteabc.org
(editable fields and blank by default)

NAME:
[___________] <- value 'Billy' should automatically enter here

PHONE #:
[___________] <- value '222-4444' should enter here

ADDRESS:

Hello iMacros community.  I am absolutely amped to start using this product but I am overwhelmed trying to get a few couple computing statements working.  I'm not a completely novice programmer but I use mostly R and the syntax of making these statements work is running against my expectations. 

I will show you the code I have so far (only using the direct control instead of calling elements) with comments on what I'm trying to do. I've been reading through the wiki on how to approach these statements more than a couple times and now I think its time to ask for a little guidance even though I'm starting from an early stage.

After running the code elsewhere I can see that it is sensitive to the font and sizing of the browser so playing with it is necessary (duh). What I am trying to show is that I am doing the following order of steps

1. Go to the pubic court document website
2. click to search (I don't start out step one at the search form because the site is very painfully tracking my session)
3. Enter in my case code starting from 0. and click search
4. Click the first result
5. save the whole html file
6. repeat with the case number at 1,2, ...

Here is the TL:DR questions of my dilemma: 

Q1. How can I click dynamic links like I do in step 2 without using direct screen? (I found something on this under X/Y at http://wiki.imacros.net/First_Steps but I need a little more guidance as someone who has only finished the first half of javascript at code academy)

Q2. How can I run a ""while"" loop to conditionally only return cases that have links in step 4 (and hence, are real). 

Q3. Under Play, I can choose to either run a script or run a loop where I set the limit outside the script.  How can I set a limit to my loop within the script. 

Q4.  If I want to run multiple loops in one script with different limits how can I do this so the loop is contained within its respective code.

*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

Having Major Trouble Scraping Tables,"I am trying to rip table data from this page:

I want the table of items to be extracted as either HTML or CSV, and to retain the following information in each row:

 2) Name of Item
 3) Platform

I have tried this many different ways - extracting the table, extracting rows, etc.  The closest I can get is a CSV file which includes the table with all the data.  However, the ""del"" link (and other links in that cell) gets extracted as plaintext and not as a link.  I have tried extracting to CSV and HTML.  When I extract to HTML the output HTML file includes everything above the table, and not just the table.

I have tried this using the Text Extraction Wizard from the demo of Pro, and despite using different outputs, none of them have given me the results needed.  Scripts are run under iMacros for Firefox 8.8.1.

"New to Macro programming, Quick initial question","I have a basic programming background, and am willing to learn the necessary steps of writing a proper macro on my own, contingent upon the answer to this question. I'm planning on using iMacros for Firefox on Windows 7 or Mac OSX 10.6.8 (I have both available), and I'm curious if what I'm about to describe is possible.

This is the website I want to scrape for names: http://www.faseb.org/The-Directory/Sear ... ctory.aspx. I want to collect information about employees at certain organizations by running a search and selecting the link for their name. The link to THAT webpage is what holds most of the information I want. However, it's easy enough to filter by an institution name, but there is no unique URL for a page with a specific list of results. This posed a problem for my normal scraping software (outwit hub), where I used that program to write a macro that would work, if not for the fact that at the start of the execution of the macro, it loads the original page URL first (which always results in the default search page, AKA a blank page with no results). Selecting the ""search"", ""clear"" and the "">>"" buttons on the page don't load unique URLS, so makes me think that the database is just an active query or something, which makes automating using the program I have (outwit) a problem. 

Could I write a macro using iMacros for Firefox on either a Windows 7 machine or a Mac running Windows 7 or Mac OSX 10.6.8 that would allow me to extract data from a search described above while cycling through the resulting links on each page of the search? I'm sorry if this sounds a bit technically illiterate or beginnerish. Normally I would just say, ""hey why not just jump in and if I discover it's not possible a couple days in it was worth the experience"", but this is more of a time issue since I would need to have these contacts available by next week. Thank you for any help and I appreciate your patience with me!",1

The challenge:
The second property has another POS numbers EXCEPT for the URL. That has the same POS number as the first property: 1.

Also need to know if I need the 'extended' version or could do these kind of things with the basic version.

Looking for some opensource scraping software,"I'm looking for an opensource scraper which can do (or be modified to do) this:

Parameters:
1. An array of candidate matches, e.g. ['email', 'contact', 'about'] or ['ceo', 'owner', 'founder'] etc.
2. An initial webpage to start from
3. A regular expression to match against (e.g. one for emails, or addresses)

Function: 
1. Check the page to see if the regular expression matches, and if successful, add the match to some sort of 'matches' object. 
2. Next, open any link, button, input, etc. which contains in its innerHTML or value or href (etc.) anything inside of the array of candidate matches. 
3. Repeat step 1, but do not crawl through a webpage that has already been crawled, and do not crawl through webpages that are off the initial domain.

I do not have the system resources to crawl through all the pages on a given domain, nor need one actually. Rather, I need a crawler that will only check links that seem viable given the array of candidate matches.

I don't want to re-invent the wheel and build a crawler out of scratch, but I am willing to take an opensource crawler and re-program some of it to meet my needs. I'm hoping for at least a good jumping off point.

"Open Google Search results, extract text","Hi,

I think what I want to do is pretty simple, but I have never used iMacros for data extraction and am having some trouble. Hopefully I can explain it clearly.

What I want to do is:

1) start on a page with Google search results open
2) Click the first result
3) Copy the URL
4) Paste the URL into a CSV cell
5) Copy the text on the page
6) Paste the text into a CSV cell BESIDE THE URL CELL
7) Close the browser tab (go back to TAB 1 search results)
 Click the next result
9) Repeat steps 3-8 for all 10 results on the first search page
10) Go to the second page of results
11) Repeat entire process for this page

...and so on. So basically this macro would open every search result and save all of the text, until I stop it or there are no more results. I'm sure someone has done this, but I searched and nothing looked like what I want. Some looked 

I tried doing this myself, and I could not even get as far as opening the first search result. When I just click the result, it uses the code ATTR=TXT:[NAME OF SEARCH RESULT]. This will not work, I want it to click on the first search result no matter what the page title is, so that I can use the macro on every page.

If someone could walk me through this whole process I'd really appreciate it! I've watched a few tutorials here and there and read some threads, but most of it is addressed to someone who has some basic knowledge, and I have barely any. 

Please assume the latest version of Firefox and the latest version of iMacros - I am not currently at my home computer so I don't know the version number, but I'll install whatever version you know how to use if it means I can figure this out.",2

"Help with NESTED LOOPS, please (Simple url changing proble","Hello I am very new to this and I was hoping that somebody might be able to help.
Essentially I need to save the content of several internet pages and I want to change the url each time after I have successfully saved a page.
Here is the code I have attempted to write

Code: Select all

To explain myself better, say I want to go to the url: GOTO=http://tds.hycom.org/X.Y
where for example X would be between 100-259 and Y between 50-175
I want to open and save the page contents for X=100 and vary Y between all of its values (50-175)
then move on to X=101, do all the Y values
and so on and so forth.

Please help if you know a quick solution to my problem.",4

Using EVAL to remove spaces and rows from extracted text,"Dear all,

I would like to rise up the question of using the EVAL command for simple modifications of extracted text.

In my case when using the Code: Select allTAG POS=r2 TYPE=SPAN FORM=NAME:Main ATTR=* EXTRACT=TXT I get result in the form
Code: Select all""


the result is:

1234 Euro

thank you for searching""

I have studied the EVAL page in the wiki
but I guess because of my lack of knowledge of the java language, I am not able to understand how to ""say"" that I would like the spaces, new rows and text=""Euro"" or text=""the result is:"" or text=""thank you for searching"" to be replaced with """" (in other words I am interested in the 1234 value only).

I guess the key is in this function 
Code: Select alls.replace(\""USD\"",\""\"")

but I do not understand how to modify it to serve my needs.

Thank you in advance for your support and advise 

Kind regards,
