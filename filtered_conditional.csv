0,How to switch to new window in Selenium for Python?,"
I am working on selenium automation project using Python.
I am facing an issue, which is handling multiple browser windows.
Scenario is as follows. When I click a link on the home page, a new window opens. In the newly opened window I cannot perform any actions, because the focus is still on the home page web driver.
Can anybody show me how to change focus from the background window to the newly opened window?
A possible solution is driver.switch_to.window(), but it requires the window's name. How to find out the window's name? If this is a wrong way to do this, can anybody give some code examples to perform this action?

1,Add an event to all Forms in a Project,"
If I want to display the size of every Form in my Project in the Form's Title what will be the best approach?
I don't want to manually put a event handler in every Form.
I want the process to be automatic.Something like a overloaded Load() event that adds a handler on the resize event.

2,Python - Control window with pywinauto while the window is minimized or hidden,"
What I'm trying to do:
I'm trying to create a script in python with pywinauto to automatically install notepad++ in the background (hidden or minimized), notepad++ is just an example since I will edit it to work with other software.
Problem:
The problem is that I want to do it while the installer is hidden or minimized, but if I move my mouse the script will stop working.
Question:
How can I execute this script and make it work, while the notepad++ installer is hidden or minimized.
This is my code so far:
import sys, os, pywinauto

pwa_app = pywinauto.application.Application()

app = pywinauto.Application().Start(r'npp.6.8.3.Installer.exe')

Wizard = app['Installer Language']

Wizard.NextButton.Click()

Wizard = app['Notepad++ v6.8.3 Setup']

Wizard.Wait('visible')

Wizard['Welcome to the Notepad++ v6.8.3 Setup'].Wait('ready')
Wizard.NextButton.Click()

Wizard['License Agreement'].Wait('ready')
Wizard['I &Agree'].Click()

Wizard['Choose Install Location'].Wait('ready')
Wizard.Button2.Click()

Wizard['Choose Components'].Wait('ready')
Wizard.Button2.Click()

Wizard['Create Shortcut on Desktop'].Wait('enabled').CheckByClick()
Wizard.Install.Click()

Wizard['Completing the Notepad++ v6.8.3 Setup'].Wait('ready', timeout=30)
Wizard['CheckBox'].Wait('enabled').Click()
Wizard.Finish.Click()
Wizard.WaitNot('visible')

3,Selenium: Drag and Drop from file system to WebDriver?,"
I have to test a web-application which contains a drag and drop area for uploading files from the local file system. My test environment is based on C#.
For the automation testing I have used Selenium, but it is not possible to drag files from the file system. The upload area is a div tag (no input tag). So what's the best way to do it? AutoIt (is it possible to drop in a web browser)? Sikuli?

6,"What's a good, if any, .NET Windows automation library?","
I'm looking for a library that can be used in native .NET code, just like any .NET assembly. The purpose of the library must be to automate Windows (push a button, select a window, send keys, record & playback, that sort of thing).
So: the library is supposed to be used natively in .NET, but the automation itself must be able to target any native or .NET Windows application that can receive user input.

Suggestions so far:

benPearce suggested AutoIt. It has a DLL, which is native Win32 but not native .NET and cannot be used without use of .NET Interop.
Chris Dunaway suggested Global Mouse Keyboard Lib. This came closest, but is not an automation lib. It just helps setting up keyboard and mouse hooks.
pm100 suggested Microsoft's WPF UI Automation. This one is pretty good, albeit that it's not available if you develop in .NET 2.0 and it requires the WPF to be installed on the system. It can, however, automate everything from Win32 apps to HTML in a browser.
JasonTrue suggested WebAI from ArtOfTest. This is a testing framework mainly geared towards browsers and web applications. It is unfortunately not well suitable for use for Windows automation.

If nothing else appears available, I'll probably choose Microsoft's UI Automation and upgrade any projects that require it that are still in .NET 2.0 to .NET 3.5, if possible. But I hope for a more widely applicable automation framework (.NET prior to 2.0 does not need to be supported).

7,UI Automation events stop being received after a while monitoring an application and then restart after some time,"
We are using Microsoft's UIAutomation framework to develop a client that monitors events of a specific application and responds to them in different ways. We've started with the managed version of the framework, but due to delay issues, moved to the native version wrapped in UIACOMWrapper. After more issues with performance inside our (massive) WPF application, we decided to move it to a separate terminal application (transfer the events to our WPF app through UDP) which seemed to fix all the performance issues. The only problem is that it seems that every several minutes, the events for TabSelection, StructureChanged, WindowOpened and WindowClosed stop being captured for a few minutes. Surprisingly PropertyChanged events are still received and handled while this happens. I will post the relevant code of our event monitor, but this is probably irrelevant as we have seen similar behavior when using Microsoft's own AccEvent utility. I can't post the code of the monitored application as it is proprietary and confidential as well, I can say that it is a WinForms application that hosts WPF windows and also quite massive.
Has anyone seen this sort of behavior while working with the UI Automation framework?
Thank you for your time.

EDIT: 
I forgot to mention that I strongly suspect that the issue is that one of the UI-Automation event handler threads gets stuck somehow. The reason I believe this, is that when the problem occurred in my monitor, I started an instance of AccEvent and it received all the missing events that my monitor was not getting. This means that the events are being fired but not passed to my monitor.
EDIT2:
I forgot to mention that this happens running in Windows 8 with the specific target application, I have not seen this phenomenon on my own Windows 7 machine with other applications. Another interesting thing is that it seems to happen periodically more or less, but regardless of when I subscribe to events, i.e. it can happen almost immediately after subscribing but then it takes several minutes to reoccur.

8,How to get selected text from ANY window (using UI Automation) - C#,"
I have a small tray application which registers a system-wide hotkey. When the user selects a text anywhere in any application and presses this hotkey I want to be able to capture the selected text. I'm currently doing this using AutomationElements:
//Using FocusedElement (since the focused element should be the control with the selected text?)
AutomationElement ae = AutomationElement.FocusedElement;        
AutomationElement txtElement = ae.FindFirst(TreeScope.Subtree,Condition.TrueCondition);
if(txtElement == null)
    return;

TextPattern tp;

try
{
    tp = txtElement.GetCurrentPattern(TextPattern.Pattern) as TextPattern;
}
catch(Exception ex)
{
    return;
}

TextPatternRange[] trs;

if (tp.SupportedTextSelection == SupportedTextSelection.None)
{
    return;
            }
else
{
    trs = tp.GetSelection();
    string selectedText = trs[0].GetText(-1);
    MessageBox.Show(selectedText );

}

This works for some apps (such as notepad, visual studios edit boxes and such) but not for all (such as Word, FireFox, Chrome, and so on.)
Anyone here with any ideas of how to be able to retreive the selected text in ANY application?

9,Capture Button Click event inside a MessageBox in another application,"
I want to capture the OK Button's Click event on a MessageBox shown by another WinForms application.
I want to achieve this using UI Automation. After some research, I have found that IUIAutomation::AddAutomationEventHandler will do the work for me.  
Though, I can capture the Click event of any other button, I'm unable to capture a Click event of the MessageBox.  
My code is as follows:  
var FindDialogButton = appElement.FindFirst(TreeScope.Descendants, new PropertyCondition(AutomationElement.NameProperty, ""OK""));

if (FindDialogButton != null)
{
    if (FindDialogButton.GetSupportedPatterns().Any(p => p.Equals(InvokePattern.Pattern)))
    {
        Automation.AddAutomationEventHandler(InvokePattern.InvokedEvent, FindDialogButton, TreeScope.Element, new AutomationEventHandler(DialogHandler));
    }
}

private void DialogHandler(object sender, AutomationEventArgs e)
{
    MessageBox.Show(""Dialog Button clicked at : "" + DateTime.Now);
}


EDIT: 
My Complete code is as follows:  
private void DialogButtonHandle()
{
    AutomationElement rootElement = AutomationElement.RootElement;
    if (rootElement != null)
    {
        System.Windows.Automation.Condition condition = new PropertyCondition
     (AutomationElement.NameProperty, ""Windows Application""); //This part gets the handle of the Windows application that has the MessageBox

        AutomationElement appElement = rootElement.FindFirst(TreeScope.Children, condition);

        var FindDialogButton = appElement.FindFirst(TreeScope.Descendants, new PropertyCondition(AutomationElement.NameProperty, ""OK"")); // This part gets the handle of the button inside the messagebox
        if (FindDialogButton != null)
        {
            if (FindDialogButton.GetSupportedPatterns().Any(p => p.Equals(InvokePattern.Pattern)))
            {
                Automation.AddAutomationEventHandler(InvokePattern.InvokedEvent, FindDialogButton, TreeScope.Element, new AutomationEventHandler(DialogHandler)); //Here I am trying to catch the click of ""OK"" button inside the MessageBox

    }

13,Run event when any Form loads,"
I'm trying to create a Popularity Contest for Forms in our primary front end. There are many items that are no longer used, but getting details on which are used and which are no longer used is proving to be difficult.
So I came up with the idea of logging a form when it is loaded and then in a year or so I'll run a group by and get an idea of which forms are used, how often, and by who. Now the issue is that I don't want to add a line to every forms InitializeComponent block. Instead I would like to put this in the Program.cs file and some how intercept all Form loads so I can log them.
Is this possible?

TEMPLATE=""/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Instruments.app/Contents/PlugIns/AutomationInstrument.bundle/Contents/Resources/Automation.tracetemplate""
MY_APP=""/Users/Me/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/6.0/Applications/564ED15A-A435-422B-82C4-5AE7DBBC27DD/MyApp.app""
RESULTS=""/Users/Me/Projects/MyApp/Tests/UI/Traces/Automation.trace""
SCRIPT=""/Users/Me/Projects/MyApp/Tests/UI/SomeTest.js""
instruments -t $TEMPLATE $MY_APP -e UIASCRIPT $SCRIPT -e UIARESULTSPATH $RESULTS

When I build this target it succeeds after a few seconds, but the script didn't actually run. In the build log I get these errors:
instruments[7222:707] Failed to load Mobile Device Locator plugin
instruments[7222:707] Failed to load Simulator Local Device Locator plugin
instruments[7222:707] Automation Instrument ran into an exception while trying to run the script.  UIATargetHasGoneAWOLException
+0000 Fail: An error occurred while trying to run the script.
Instruments Trace Complete (Duration : 1.077379s; Output : /Users/Me/Projects/MyApp/Tests/UI/Traces/Automation.trace)

I am pretty sure, that my javascript and my run script are both correct, because if I run the exact same instruments command in bash it works as expected. 
Could this be a bug in Xcode?

16,AutomationProperties.Name VS x:Name,"
There is no difference for the ""CodedUI test builder"" between the AutomationProperties.Name and x:Name. But the first one can override the second one.
Also the AtomationProperties.Name supports data binding, x:Name of course doesn't.
As we know if you are using the MVVM pattern it is best to only use x:Name when needed.
So should AutomationProperties.Name be preferred to x:Name?

17,set text on textfield / textbox with the automation framework and get the change event,"
I want to set a text on a textfield / textbox element with the Mircosoft UI Automation framework, that means on a AutomationElement from the ControlType.Edit or ControlType.Document.
At the moment i'm using the TextPattern to get the text from one of these AutomationElements:
TextPattern tp = (TextPattern)element.GetCurrentPattern(TextPattern.Pattern);
string text = tp.DocumentRange.GetText(-1).Trim();

But now I want to set a new text in the AutomationElement. I can't find a method for this in the TextPattern class. So I'm trying to use the ValuePattern but I'm not sure if that's the right way to do it:
ValuePattern value = element.GetCurrentPattern(ValuePattern.Pattern) as ValuePattern;
value.SetValue(insertText);

Is there an other way to set the text value?
An other question is how can I get an event when the text was changed on a Edit / Document element? I tried to use the TextChangedEvent but i don't get any events fired when changing the text:
AutomationEventHandler ehTextChanged = new AutomationEventHandler(text_event);
Automation.AddAutomationEventHandler(TextPattern.TextChangedEvent, element, TreeScope.Element, ehTextChanged);

private void text_event(object sender, AutomationEventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine(""Text changed"");
}

18,UIAutomation Memory Issue,"
I have a simple WPF program that just has a single button with no event handling logic.  I then use the UIAutomation framework to click that button many times in a row.  Finally, I look at the memory used by the WPF program and it seems to grow and grow.
Anyone know why this is the case and how I can prevent this from happening?
Here is the simple WPF program (nothing in the code behind):
<Window x:Class=""SimpleApplication.MainWindow""
        xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""
        xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml""
        Title=""Simple Application""
        AutomationProperties.AutomationId=""Simple Application""
        Height=""350"" Width=""525"">
    <Grid>
        <Button AutomationProperties.AutomationId=""button"" Height=""50"" Width=""100"">Click Me</Button>
    </Grid>
</Window>

Here is the UIAutomation test program:
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string appPath = @""..\..\..\SimpleApplication\bin\Debug\SimpleApplication.exe"";
        string winAutoId = ""Simple Application"";
        string buttonAutoId = ""button"";

        using (Process process = Process.Start(new ProcessStartInfo(appPath)))
        {
            Thread.Sleep(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));

            AutomationElement winElement = AutomationElement.RootElement.FindFirst(TreeScope.Children, new PropertyCondition(AutomationElement.AutomationIdProperty, winAutoId));

            for (int i = 0; i < 1001; i++)
            {
                AutomationElement buttonElement = winElement.FindFirst(TreeScope.Descendants, new PropertyCondition(AutomationElement.AutomationIdProperty, buttonAutoId));

                InvokePattern invokePattern = (InvokePattern)buttonElement.GetCurrentPattern(InvokePattern.Pattern);
                invokePattern.Invoke();

                process.Refresh();
                long totalMemory = process.WorkingSet64 + process.PagedMemorySize64;

                if (i % 100 == 0)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(""Memory = {0} MB"", ((double)totalMemory) / (1024 * 1024));
                }
            }

            WindowPattern windowPattern = (WindowPattern)winElement.GetCurrentPattern(WindowPattern.Pattern);
            windowPattern.Close();
        }

        Console.WriteLine();
        Console.WriteLine(""Press Enter to Continue..."");
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}

Here are the results from the program on my machine:
Memory = 38.20703125 MB
Memory = 42.9296875 MB
Memory = 45.00390625 MB
Memory = 47.04296875 MB
Memory = 51.9296875 MB
Memory = 52.2890625 MB

Memory = 55.70703125 MB
Memory = 55.70703125 MB
Memory = 57.21484375 MB
Memory = 59.09375 MB

Looking at it with the .NET Memory Profiler, the new objects that are appearing in the WPF application are from the System.Threading namespace.  When I run the WPF program by itself and click the button with the mouse these objects do no appear.
UPDATE:
I tried doing a similar test using Visual Studio's CodedUI, and the same 8 objects appeared to leak in that situation as well.  The objects that appear to leak are:
System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource
System.Threading.TimerQueueTimer
System.Threading.SparselyPopulatedArray<CancellationCallbackInfo>[]
System.Threading.Timer
System.Threading.TimerHolder
System.Threading.SparselyPopulatedArray<CancellationCallbackInfo>
System.Threading.SparselyPopulatedArrayFragment<CancellationCallbackInfo>
System.Threading.CancellationCallbackInfo[]

20,Is there a way to set the AutomationID of an object without using XAML?,"
I need to automate a Winform application.  How do I set the AutomationID (or AutomationName) like the the XAML in this article  does?
From this stack overflow article the answer seems to be no, unless I switch the application to a WPF application (so I can use XAML to define the controls).
I have tried this na茂ve approach:
  AutomationElement formAutomation = AutomationElement.FromHandle(this.Handle);
  formAutomation.Current.Name = ""SandboxResponseDialogName"";
  formAutomation.Current.ClassName = ""SandboxResponseDialogClassName"";
  formAutomation.Current.AutomationId = ""SandboxResponseDialogID;

But at this point in the constructor for the control, these Automation properties have getters only; no setters.

Imports System.Windows.Automation
Imports System.Windows.Automation.Text

.
Dim hwnd As IntPtr = Process.GetProcessesByName(""notepad"").First.MainWindowHandle

Dim targetApp As AutomationElement = AutomationElement.FromHandle(hwnd)

30,AutomationElement shows up using Inspect.exe but does show not up when using UIAutomationCore.dll or System.Windows.Automation,"
TL;DR: What am I doing wrong that is causing the workspace pane to show up in Inspect Objects but not show up in my custom code?

I am trying to write some UI automation to a 3rd party program. I am using Inspect.exe that came with the Windows SDK, and I have tried both System.Windows.Automation and direct COM Calls (using the wrapper library from UIA Verify).
Process[] processes = Process.GetProcessesByName(""Redacted Client"");
if (processes.Length == 0) throw new Exception(""Could not find \""Redacted Client\"" process"");

PropertyCondition parentFileCond = new PropertyCondition(AutomationElement.ProcessIdProperty, processes[0].Id);
PropertyCondition workspaceCond = new PropertyCondition(AutomationElement.NameProperty, ""Workspace"", PropertyConditionFlags.IgnoreCase);
PropertyCondition documentCond = new PropertyCondition(AutomationElement.NameProperty, ""Untitled3"", PropertyConditionFlags.IgnoreCase);

var parentElement = AutomationElement.RootElement.FindFirst(TreeScope.Children, parentFileCond);
var workspaceElement = parentElement.FindFirst(TreeScope.Children, workspaceCond); //Also does not work with TreeScope.Descendants
var documentElement = workspaceElement.FindFirst(TreeScope.Children, documentCond);

When I try the above code, parentElement does have the correct reference to the main program window, but workspaceElement is null.

A temporary workaround:
If I change my documentElement code to:
var documentElement = parentElement.FindFirst(TreeScope.Descendants, documentCond);

I will get the correct element returned. I can use this as a workaround as the document window is the one I really wanted anyway, but I would like to know why the Workspace pane would not show up so I can improve my skills in case I run into this in the future with a situation I cannot work around.

UPDATE: I tried MrGomez's suggestions
PropertyCondition parentFileCond = new PropertyCondition(AutomationElement.ProcessIdProperty, 5872);
PropertyCondition panelCond = new PropertyCondition(AutomationElement.ControlTypeProperty, ControlType.Pane);

var parentElement = AutomationElement.RootElement.FindFirst(TreeScope.Children, parentFileCond);
var panels = parentElement.FindAll(TreeScope.Children, panelCond);


I get 3 results, unfortunately, I have 4 panels, and the one that did not show up was the panel named Workspace.
I also tried to use a TreeWalker
PropertyCondition parentFileCond = new PropertyCondition(AutomationElement.ProcessIdProperty, 5872);
PropertyCondition workspaceCond= new PropertyCondition(AutomationElement.NameProperty, ""Workspace"");

var walker = new TreeWalker(workspaceCond);
var parentElement = AutomationElement.RootElement.FindFirst(TreeScope.Children, parentFileCond);
var workspaceElement = walker.Normalize(parentElement);

but that also returns null for workspaceElement
Finally, in desperation, I tried the current value of ""NativeWindowHandle"" from Inspect and started the walking from the root node.
PropertyCondition workspaceCond = new PropertyCondition(AutomationElement.NativeWindowHandleProperty, 0x110906);
var walker = new TreeWalker(workspaceCond);
var workspaceElement = walker.Normalize(AutomationElement.RootElement);

Workspace element is STILL null.

Result Found
I finally did get Workspace to show up, but I had to perform 
PropertyCondition workspaceCond = new PropertyCondition(AutomationElement.NativeWindowHandleProperty, 0x110906);
var test = AutomationElement.RootElement.FindFirst(TreeScope.Subtree, workspaceCond); 

and it took quite a while to run.

31,What's the difference of UISpy.exe and Inspect.exe? (From Microsoft Windows SDK),"
I really want to know, how Inspect.exe gets it's UI-Elements, because it gets by far more elements than UISpy (Both available in Microsoft Windows SDK 7).
1) I think UISpy gets it's elements with UIAutomation library, right?
(Tried it with UIAutomation and got exactly the same elements, that UISpy displayed).
2) Which library does Inspect.exe use?
Because it shows some UI-Elements of a Application with MacromediaFlashPlayerActiveX for example, which I need to get in my own UI-Automation-Application, hope somebody knows something about it.
EDIT: Inspect also have a ""UI Automation"" Mode, does it also use UIAutomation library? The strange thing about it is, that in Inspect it also shows many more elements than UISpy.

33,Is there Anyone who Successfully Implement UI Test Automation Regime using Microsoft UI Automation?,"
I am looking for an Automated UI test framework/ software tool. In the past I have been using TestComplete, and although it's a good piece of software, but the concept of GUI test automation was deemed to be sufficiently difficult that I wrote a few posts to complain about it. 
One of the problems with third party test automation tool is that you have to learn new language in order to be productive on it, not to mention that the tooling support is poor. I am now planning to look into Microsoft UI Automation that comes with .Net 3.0 and the White Framework. But before I do that, I want to know what's the outcome there.
Anyone has any experience to share on this? Have you create a sustainable and successful test suite using UI automation on your application?

34,Python with Selenium: Drag and Drop from file system to webdriver?,"
I have to automate a web-application, which contains a drag and drop area for uploading files from the local file system. My test environment is developed using Python. For the automation tests I have used Selenium, but it is not possible to drag files from the file system, once the upload area is a div tag (No input tag - this way I know it would be easy).
I read a lot of different articles, but by the moment none worked for me. It's important to highlight that I'm not interested in using AutoIT, only native python with selenium.
I found this Selenium: Drag and Drop from file system to webdriver? what looks really promising, however I do not know to adapt to Python.

I am using Microsoft UI Automation (i.e. AutomationElement) to run automated acceptance tests against my application. This has gone well, but I've hit a situation that doesn't appear to be exposed to the automation framework.
I have an ItemsControl (although I could be using one of its derived controls, e.g. ListBox) and I am using CollectionViewSource to group items. Here is a complete window to demonstrate:
<Window x:Class=""GroupAutomation.Window1"" xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"" xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"" Title=""Orchestra"">

            </DataTemplate>
        </ItemsControl.ItemTemplate>
    </ItemsControl>
</Window>

This produces a window containing the items grouped into their categories, and each item has a button that I'd like to click with UI Automation:

(source: brizzly.com) 
However, if I look in UISpy.exe (or navigate with AutomationElement) I only see the groups (even in the Raw view):

(source: brizzly.com) 
As you can see, the groups are there but they contain no items, so there is nowhere to look for the buttons. I have tried this in both WPF 3.5 SP1 and WPF 4.0 and get the same result.
Is it possible to use UI Automation on items that are grouped, and if so, how?

38,"When I try to use UI Automation for PowerPoint 2013, I can only get the first character/word when I use RangeFromPoint","
The code works for Word and Outlook but fails with PowerPoint in that only the first character or first word of the textbox ever gets selected. Is this a bug? Is there any workaround? Try this on a simple PowerPoint slide in PowerPoint 2013.
private static async Task<string> getText(double x, double y)
{
    string result = null;

    try
    {
        var location = new System.Windows.Point(x, y);
        AutomationElement element = AutomationElement.FromPoint(location);

        object patternObj;
        if (element.TryGetCurrentPattern(TextPattern.Pattern, out patternObj))
        {
            var textPattern = (TextPattern)patternObj;

            var range = textPattern.RangeFromPoint(location);
            range.ExpandToEnclosingUnit(TextUnit.Word);
            range.Select();

            var text = range.GetText(-1).TrimEnd('\r');
            return text.Trim();
        }

        }
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        return ex.Message;
    }
}

You cannot see it from the screenshot, but the mouse is on ""first"" not ""stuck"", but regardless of where the mouse is placed, it always is stuck. Maybe this is fixed in PowerPoint 2016?

When I look at the bounding box for the range it is always the whole element, rather than the selected word. That could be part of the problem of why RangeToPoint is not working.
Original posted in MSDN but no response...
Update. If I use 
text = printRange(range, text);
while (range.Move(TextUnit.Word, 1) > 0)
{
    text += Environment.NewLine;

40,How to inject click event with Android UiAutomation.injectInputEvent,"
I'm automating the testing of a flow in my app where I install a device administrator.  To activate a device administrator on most devices (let's assume here I don't have some enterprise API that lets me do this like what Samsung offers) the system displays a popup to the user who then has to click the ""Activate"" button.
I'm using Robotium and Android JUnit to drive my tests.  In a normal testing case one can only interact with the app and process under test and not any system activities that come up.
The UiAutomation claims to allow you to interact with other applications by leveraging the Accessibility Framework, and then allowing one to inject arbitrary input events.
So - here's what I'm trying to do:
public class AbcTests extends ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2<AbcActivity> {

    private Solo mSolo

    @Override
    public void setUp() {
        mSolo = new Solo(getInstrumentation(), getActivity());

    }

    ...

    public void testAbc(){
    
        final UiAutomation automation = getInstrumentation().getUiAutomation();         
        
        MotionEvent motionDown = MotionEvent.obtain(SystemClock.uptimeMillis(), SystemClock.uptimeMillis(), KeyEvent.ACTION_DOWN,
                100,  100, 0);

        automation.injectInputEvent(motionDown, true)
        MotionEvent motionUp = MotionEvent.obtain(SystemClock.uptimeMillis(), SystemClock.uptimeMillis(), KeyEvent.ACTION_UP,
                100, 100, 0);

        automation.injectInputEvent(motionUp, true)
        motionUp.recycle();
        motionDown.recycle();
     }
    
 }

When this test is run the System popup to ""Activate"" the device administrator is active, and I want to just click on the screen.  I've hardcoded in 100,100 as the position for clicks for the purposes of this question but realistically I'll click in the bottom right corner of the screen so I can hit the button.
I do not get any click events occurring on the screen.  Does anyone have experience with this?   Are there any alternatives to do what I want to do?  From my understanding there are very few tools that do this.
Thanks.

41,How to check element properties in iOS gui automation?,"
All UI Automation examples I've seen uses standard components whose state can be inspected with the JavaScript API using the value() method. This is a bit limiting. Lets say you want to check the color or alpha value and whatnot.
How can I inspect the properties of a view?
An example: a tap on a certain element should make it ""selected"". I'd like to perform a tap on it and then verify that isSelected is TRUE.
Update:
I found the withPredicate() method which should do it in theory, except it seems to only trigger on name properties:
element.withPredicate(""isSelected == YES"")          // always fails
element.withPredicate(""name matches 'my element'"")  // works

  foreach (AutomationElement child in children)

Generally speaking, the code works quite well in most cases. The tree is populated and I have a bit of other supporting code allowing me to double click, for example, an element in the tree-view and it will highlight that element on the target form.
The issue I'm having is that, while it generates an awesome tree, there are still some elements missing for certain target programs.

I'd like to use C# to interact with the IE browser. 
I have a feeling that shdocvw.dll will be involved, but there are so many classes in there that I don't know where to start, and maybe it's not even necessary to use it.
The goal here is to interact with a website, visiting it's pages and ""warming it up,"" not unlike as described here by Kenneth Scott.  The thing is, javascript is getting executed as you interact with a website, so it would be nice just to be able to login / submit forms exactly as you would on the website itself.
Plus it would be nice to be able to create a program that records my actions in IE, and then be able to slightly automate and slightly modify them.
Additionally, it would be nice if it could do all this in the background, without having to display the webpage at all.
I'm not looking for third party solutions, I want to do this myself (with your advice of course.)

Doesn't have any text value but need to get title attribute value #abcdd in this case.
Need a generic code to get all such title attribute values present inside this table.
Where are the things going wrong? Any way I can handle this? Or that text value needs to be included in html?

51,Cross platform solution for automating ncurses-type telnet sessions,"
Background
Part of my work in networking and telco involves automating telnet sessions when legacy hardware doesn't offer easy solutions in other interfaces. Many older pieces of equipment can only be accessed via craft ports (RS-232 serial ports), SNMP, or telnet. Sometimes telnet is the only way to access specific information, however telnet is designed as a human interface and thus requires screen scraping. In addition, there is also the issue of scraping screens where only portions are updated in order to save bandwidth (see ncurses). In my work I have used ActiveState Expect and the Python telnet library.
Question
Which languages and libraries are able to automate telnet sessions and have the following requirements:

Suitable for large projects (e.g. Tcl
doesn't seem to scale as well as
Python in my experience and seems outdated)
Cross Platform (e.g. Pexpect does not work on Windows and Activestate
Expect behaves differently on
Windows plus requires DEP on newer
machines to be turned off)
Able to screen scrape sessions that repaint portions of the screen
(similar to the behavior of ncurses in command-line programs)
Free as in beer!

A preferable solution would also include the following:

Easily redistributable (e.g. Does not
require some huge runtime to be installed on a machine.)
Also works for SSH, serial connections, and other command-line interfaces.

52,arguments[0].click() not working for select option in selenium,"
I am using selenium for the web application automation.
 I stuck in one point,I am using .ExecuteScript() to perform some action like to click on a link and for that am using :-
((IJavaScriptExecutor)driver).ExecuteScript(""arguments[0].click()"", driver.FindElement(By.XPath(""//a[contains(text(),'Login to the Demo')]"")));

[Note : for every click-able element am using ,this approach because click-able element may be hidden or not visible in web page]
But this approach is not working for  <select> <option>item<option> .. </select>
I am using below code clicking on one of the select option :
((IJavaScriptExecutor)driver).ExecuteScript(""arguments[0].click()"", driver.FindElement(By.XPath(""//select[@id='form_switcher']/option[5]"")));

but nothing is happening nor giving any error/exception.
--Edit start--
But if I use without ExecuteScript() then its work fine:
driver.FindElement(By.XPath(""//select[@id='form_switcher']/option[5]"")).Click();

--Edit end--
[Note : I am using click to select options so that it fire the change event.]
So can anyone please explain me how to click on the select option using ((IJavaScriptExecutor)driver).ExecuteScript


Thanks in advance.

54,iOS/UI Automation: UIAActionSheet does not have possibilities to manipulate with buttons,"
My question is related to UI Automation template from XCode's Instruments tool. How does UI Automation support UIActionSheet testing? I know that there is a UIAActionSheet element and I was able to obtain it in my application. But I do not know how to get and manipulate with buttons from the action sheet. UI Automation does not provide any elements for these buttons. The UI Automation documentation does not have any info on the matter either. See the link below. It looks like this control does not use UIButton class for the buttons and renders them in some specific way. Could you give me some clue how to reach the buttons from UIAActionSheet? Thank you.

63,Why doesn't UI Automation condition find element by UIA_IsScrollPatternAvailablePropertyId?,"
I wanted to find the element within a main window handle that allows scrolling.  So instead of finding scrollbars and then the owner of the scrollbars I wanted to just return the items that allow scrolling via a ScrollPattern so I setup the condition on that but nothing is found. if I search for scrollbar owner window then get the ScrollPattern it works.  Why can't I just find the elements that have a scroll pattern available?
Here's the common code:
BOOL CUIAutomateScroller::FindWindow(HWND hwnd, IUIAutomationElement **windowelement)
{
  BOOL result=FALSE;
  // make sure init completed
  if (m_pClientUIA) {
    // get window element
    HRESULT hr=m_pClientUIA->ElementFromHandle(hwnd, windowelement);
    // check result
    result=SUCCEEDED(hr);
    // output debug info
    if (FAILED(hr)) {
      CDebugPrint::DebugPrint(_T(""ElementFromHandle error: %d\n""), hr);
    }
    else {
      _ASSERT(*windowelement!=NULL);
    }
  }
  return result;
}

BOOL CUIAutomateScroller::FindContainerWindowElement(const long controltype, IUIAutomationElement **pelement)
{
  // Create search condition
  VARIANT varprop;
  varprop.vt=VT_I4;
  varprop.uintVal=controltype;

  CComPtr<IUIAutomationCondition> pcondition;
  HRESULT hr=m_pClientUIA->CreatePropertyCondition(UIA_ControlTypePropertyId, varprop, &pcondition);
  if (FAILED(hr)) {
    CDebugPrint::DebugPrint(_T(""CreatePropertyCondition error: %d\n""), hr);
    return NULL;
  }

  // find the control based on condition
  CComPtr<IUIAutomationElementArray> pcontrolelementarr;
  hr=m_pWindowElement->FindAll(TreeScope_Subtree, pcondition, &pcontrolelementarr);
  if (FAILED(hr)) {
    CDebugPrint::DebugPrint(_T(""CreatePropertyCondition error: %d\n""), hr);
    return NULL;
  }

  // get number of controls found
  int numfound;
  pcontrolelementarr->get_Length(&numfound);
  CDebugPrint::DebugPrint(_T(""Controls Found: %d\n""), numfound);

  // process controls found, but really we exit earily if container window found
  for (int i=0; i < numfound; i++) {
    // get individual control element
    CComPtr<IUIAutomationElement> pcontrolelement;
    hr=pcontrolelementarr->GetElement(i, &pcontrolelement);

    hr=pcontrolelement->get_CurrentName(&name);
    if (FAILED(hr)) {
      CDebugPrint::DebugPrint(_T(""GetCurrentName error: %d\n""), hr);
    }
    CDebugPrint::DebugPrint(_T(""Control Name: %s\n""), name);
    name.Empty();

    hr=pcontrolelement->get_CurrentClassName(&name);
    if (FAILED(hr)) {
      CDebugPrint::DebugPrint(_T(""GetCurrentClass error: %d\n""), hr);
    }
    CDebugPrint::DebugPrint(_T(""Class Name: %s\n""), name);
    name.Empty();

    CComPtr<IUIAutomationTreeWalker> pcontentwalker=NULL;
    hr=m_pClientUIA->get_ContentViewWalker(&pcontentwalker);
    if (pcontentwalker == NULL) {
      return NULL;
    }

    // Get ancestor element nearest to the scrollbar UI Automation element in the tree view
    hr=pcontentwalker->NormalizeElement(pcontrolelement, pelement);
    if (FAILED(hr)) {
      CDebugPrint::DebugPrint(_T(""NormalizeElement error: %d\n""), hr);

    }
    CDebugPrint::DebugPrint(_T(""Ancestor Name: %s\n""), name);
    name.Empty();

    return TRUE;
  }

  return FALSE;
}

This does NOT work (It doesn't find anything):
  // get main window
  if (FindWindow(hwnd, &m_pWindowElement)) {
    HRESULT hr;
    VARIANT varprop;
      
    // create condition for elements that have UIA_IsScrollPatternAvailablePropertyId available

    // check result
    if (FAILED(hr)) {
      CDebugPrint::DebugPrint(_T(""CreatePropertyCondition for ScrollPattern Error: %d\n""), hr);
    }
    else {
      // find the matching element
      CComPtr<IUIAutomationElementArray> pscrollpatternarr;
      hr=m_pWindowElement->FindAll(TreeScope_Subtree, pscrollpatterncondition, &pscrollpatternarr);
      // check result (normal is success with empty array if not found)
      if (FAILED(hr)) {
        CDebugPrint::DebugPrint(_T(""FindAll Error: %d\n""), hr);
      }
      else {
        // get number of elements in array
        int numfound=0;
        pscrollpatternarr->get_Length(&numfound);
        // make sure we only get one scrollable area - in the future we could figure out the rect
        // **numfound is 0**

This DOES work:
  // get main window
  if (FindWindow(hwnd, &m_pWindowElement)) {
    // get scrollable window element based on scrollbar
    if (FindContainerWindowElement(UIA_ScrollBarControlTypeId, &m_pScrollableElement)) {
      HRESULT hr;
      // get the scroll pattern
      hr=m_pScrollableElement->GetCurrentPattern(UIA_ScrollPatternId, (IUnknown**) &m_pScrollPattern);
      if (FAILED(hr)) {
        CDebugPrint::DebugPrint(_T(""GetCurrentPattern for Scroll Pattern Error %d:\n""), hr);
      }
      else if (m_pScrollPattern!=NULL) {
        // **we're good!!**

We need to do some fairly complex web automation from C++ application (log into application, do some actions, logout), but performance is really important so we are looking at options.

Is there a way to drive WebKit or other headless engine directly from C++, without the need for few more layers in between (like selenium+webdriver+network communication+...)? Chromedriver perhaps?

66,Execute javascript trough Internet Explorer's com interface using PowerShell,"
I am writing some Internet Explorer automation scripts using PowerShell. Here is how I start the IE com object:
$ie = New-Object -com ""InternetExplorer.Application""
$ie.Navigate(""about:blank"")
$ie.visible = $true

$doc = $ie.Document

So, what I would like to do is to execute some javascript on the $doc object. For example, I have an item on the page that has an onclick event which executes submitCommand('lookup'), so I'd like to run that directly on the $doc instead of having to find the object on the page and then calling the Click() method on it.
It would be easier as the object has no name nor id, making it very sensible to change as I can only rely on it's position on the page (eg: the 11th span item on the page).
Alternatively, how would you select elements based on their class? That would help a lot as the ""button"" has it's own class.

68,Selenium Webdriver vs Mechanize,"
I am interested in automating repetitive data entry in some forms for a website I frequent. So far the tools I've looked up that would provide support for this in a headless fashion could be Selenium WebDriver and Mechanize. 
My question is, is there a fundamental technical difference in using once versus the other? Selenium is mostly used for testing. I've also noticed some folks use it for doing exactly what I'm looking for, and that's automating data entry. Testing becomes a second benefit in that case. 
Is there reasons to not use Selenium for what I want to do over Mechanize? Does it not matter and both of these tools will work? 
I'm not asking which is better, I'm asking which is the right tool for the job. Perhaps I'm not understanding the premise behind the purpose of each tool.

I'm trying to automate the task of querying for data on this site using Puppeteer. So I need to select the dataset (Daily Summaries, 1st option), then select location type (State, 3rd option), then select state (Alaska, 2nd option). The problem is my code does not change to the next table. So instead of selecting the 3rd option (State) after selecting the 1st option in dataset (Daily Summaries), it just selects the 3rd option but in dataset table again! I am new to Puppeteer so I don't really know what to do with this. Any help is appreciated.
Below is my code:


const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless:false})
  const page = await browser.newPage()

  const navigationPromise = page.waitForNavigation()

  await page.goto('https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/selectlocation')

  await page.waitForSelector('.selectLocationFilters > .datasetContainer > .slideElement > #datasetSelect > option:nth-child(1)')
  await page.click('.selectLocationFilters > .datasetContainer > .slideElement > #datasetSelect > option:nth-child(1)')

  await page.select('.inset #locationCategorySelect', '')

  await page.waitForSelector('.selectLocationFilters > .locationCategoryContainer > .locationCategoryFilter > #locationCategorySelect > option:nth-child(3)')
  await page.click('.selectLocationFilters > .locationCategoryContainer > .locationCategoryFilter > #locationCategorySelect > option:nth-child(3)')

  await page.select('.inset #selectedState', '')

  await page.waitForSelector('.selectLocationFilters > .locationContainer > .stateFilter > #selectedState > option:nth-child(2)')
  await page.click('.selectLocationFilters > .locationContainer > .stateFilter > #selectedState > option:nth-child(2)')

  await browser.close()
})()


This is what I want. Dataset -> Location type -> State Alaska. Instead the code keeps selecting only in the Dataset table.

74,Multi-threaded C# Selenium WebDriver automation with Uris not known beforehand,"
I need to perform some simultaneous webdrivers manipulation, but I am uncertain as to how to do this.
What I am asking here is: 

What is the correct way to achieve this ?
What is the reason for the exception I am getting (revealed below)

After some research I ended up with:
1. The way I see people doing this (and the one I ended up using after playing with the API, before searching) is to loop over the window handles my WebDriver has at hand, and perform a switch to and out of the window handle I want to process, closing it when I am finished.
2. Selenium Grid does not seem like an option fore me - am I wrong or it is intended for parallel processing ? Since am running everything in a single computer, it will be of no use for me.

In trying the 1st option, I have the following scenario (a code sample is available below, I skipped stuff that is not relevant/repeat itself (where ever I added 3 dots:
I have a html page, with several submit buttons, stacked.
Clicking each of them will open a new browser/tab (interestingly enough, using ChromeDriver opens tabs, while FirefoxDriver opens separate windows for each.)
As a side note: I can't determine the uris of each submit beforehand (they must be determined by javascript, and at this point, let's just assume I want to handle everything knowing nothing about the client code.
Now, after looping over all the submit buttons, and issuing webElement.Click() on the corresponding elements, the tabs/windows open. The code flows to create a list of tasks to be executed, one for each new tab/window.
The problem is: since all tasks all depend upon the same instance of webdriver to switch to the window handles, seems I will need to add resource sharing locks/control. I am uncertain as whether I am correct, since I saw no mention of locks/resource access control in searching for multi-threaded web driver examples.
On the other hand, if I am able to determine the tabs/windows uris beforehand, I would be able to skip all the automation steps needed to reach this point, and then creating a webDriver instance for each thread, via Navigate().GoToUrl() would be straightforward. But this looks like a deadlock! I don't see webDriver's API providing any access to the newly opened tab/window without performing a switch. And I only want to switch if I do not have to repeat all the automation steps that lead me to the current window !
...
In any case, I keep getting the exception:
Element belongs to a different frame than the current one - switch to its containing frame to use it
at 
IWebElement element = cell.FindElement

inside the ToDictionary() block.
I obviously checked that all my selectors are returning results, in chrome's console. 
foreach (WebElement resultSet in resultSets)
    resultSet.Click();


foreach(string windowHandle in webDriver.WindowHandles.Skip(1))
{
    dataCollectionTasks.Add(Task.Factory.StartNew<List<DataTable>>(obj =>

        if (window != null)

the translation is displayed in the bottom  content frame out of the two frames. I am interested in retrieving only the bottom content frame to get the translations 
selenium for python allows us to fetch page contents via web automation:
browser.get('http://translate.google.com/#en/ar/'+hurl)

The required frame is an iframe :
<div id=""contentframe"" style=""top:160px""><iframe   src=""/translate_p?hl=en&am... name=c frameborder=""0"" style=""height:100%;width:100%;position:absolute;top:0px;bottom:0px;""></div></iframe>

but how to get the bottom content frame element to retrieve the translations using web automation?
Came to know that PyQuery also allows us to browse the contents using the JQuery formalism
Update:
An answer mentioned that Selenium provides a method where you can do that.
frame = browser.find_element_by_tag_name('iframe')
browser.switch_to_frame(frame)
# get page source
browser.page_source

but it does not work in the above example. It returns an empty page .

I'm trying to put list of possible solutions for browser automatic tests suits and headless browser platforms capable of scraping.

BROWSER TESTING / SCRAPING:

Selenium - polyglot flagship in browser automation, bindings for Python, Ruby,  JavaScript, C#, Haskell and more, IDE for Firefox (as an extension) for faster test deployment. Can act as a Server and has tons of features.

JAVASCRIPT

PhantomJS - JavaScript, headless testing with screen capture and automation, uses Webkit. As of version 1.8 Selenium's WebDriver API is implemented, so you can use any WebDriver binding and tests will be compatible with Selenium
SlimerJS - similar to PhantomJS, uses Gecko (Firefox) instead of WebKit
CasperJS - JavaScript, build on both PhantomJS and SlimerJS, has extra features
Ghost Driver - JavaScript implementation of the WebDriver Wire Protocol for PhantomJS.
new PhantomCSS - CSS regression testing. A CasperJS module for automating visual regression testing with PhantomJS and Resemble.js.
new WebdriverCSS - plugin for Webdriver.io for automating visual regression testing
new PhantomFlow - Describe and visualize user flows through tests. An experimental approach to Web user interface testing.
new trifleJS - ports the PhantomJS API to use the Internet Explorer engine.
new CasperJS IDE (commercial)

NODE.JS

Node-phantom - bridges the gap between PhantomJS and node.js
WebDriverJs - Selenium WebDriver bindings for node.js by Selenium Team
WD.js - node module for WebDriver/Selenium 2
yiewd - WD.js wrapper using latest Harmony generators! Get rid of the callback pyramid with yield
ZombieJs - Insanely fast, headless full-stack testing using node.js
NightwatchJs - Node JS based testing solution using Selenium Webdriver
Chimera - Chimera: can do everything what phantomJS does, but in a full JS environment
Dalek.js - Automated cross browser testing with JavaScript through Selenium Webdriver
Webdriver.io - better implementation of WebDriver bindings with predefined 50+ actions
Nightmare - Electron bridge with a high-level API.
jsdom - Tailored towards web scraping. A very lightweight DOM implemented in Node.js, it supports pages with javascript.
new Puppeteer - Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium. Puppeteer runs headless by default.

WEB SCRAPING / MINING

Scrapy - Python, mainly a scraper/miner - fast, well documented and, can be linked with Django Dynamic Scraper for nice mining deployments, or Scrapy Cloud for PaaS (server-less) deployment, works in terminal or an server stand-alone proces, can be used with Celery, built on top of Twisted
Snailer - node.js module, untested yet.
Node-Crawler - node.js module, untested yet.

81,How can I catch and process the data from the XHR responses using casperjs?,"
The data on the webpage is displayed dynamically and it seems that checking for every change in the html and extracting the data is a very daunting task and also needs me to use very unreliable XPaths. So I would want to be able to extract the data from the XHR packets. 
I hope to be able to extract information from XHR packets as well as generate 'XHR' packets to be sent to the server. 
The extracting information part is more important for me because the sending of information can be handled easily by automatically triggering html elements using casperjs.
I'm attaching a screenshot of what I mean.
The text in the response tab is the data I need to process afterwards. (This XHR response has been received from the server.)

I am trying to scrape a Wine data from vivino.com and using selenium to automate it and scrape as many data as possible. My code looks like this:
import time 
from selenium import webdriver

browser = webdriver.Chrome('C:\Program Files (x86)\chromedriver.exe')

browser.get('https://www.vivino.com/explore?e=eJwFwbEOQDAUBdC_uaNoMN7NZhQLEXmqmiZaUk3x987xkVXRwLtAVcLLy7qE_tiN0Bz6FhcV7M4s0ZkkB86VUZIL9l4kmyjW4ORmbo0nTTPVDxlkGvg%3D&cart_item_source=nav-explore') # Vivino Website with 5 wines for now (simple example). Plan to scrape around 10,000 wines 

lenOfPage = browser.execute_script(""window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);var lenOfPage=document.body.scrollHeight;return lenOfPage;"")

match=False
while(match==False):
    lastCount = lenOfPage
    time.sleep(7)
    lenOfPage = browser.execute_script(""window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);var lenOfPage=document.body.scrollHeight;return lenOfPage;"")
    if lastCount==lenOfPage:
        match=True

That opens a website with 5 wines and scrolls down. Now I want to click to hyperlink of the wine one by one to scrape information about its price, wine grapes sort, etc. So, basically my script will try scroll down which allows to have as many wines displayed on the page and then click to a first hyperlink, get additional information and go back. Then, the process will repeat. I don't think that's an efficient strategy but that's what I came up so far.
The problem I have is with hyperlink in the vivino website. There is no text near the href link which allows me to use find_element_by_link_text function:
<a class=""anchor__anchor--2QZvA"" href=""/weingut-r-a-pfaffl-austrian-cherry-zweigelt/w/1261542?year=2018&amp;price_id=23409078&amp;cart_item_source=direct-explore"" target=""_blank"">

Could you please suggest the way how click for a wine with Selenium that has not text after the hyperlink? I haven't found proper answer during my web search. Thanks in advance

Note: the html5 standards-mode opt-in doctype html

Except that the document is not in ie9 standards mode; it's in ie8 standards mode:

and then view that html document, IE is put into standards mode:

   webDocument = ie.Document;
   webDocument.Write(html);
   webDocument.Close();

Edit: A more verbose, less understandable or readable code sample, that doesn't help further the question might be:

CoCreateInstance(CLASS_InternetExplorer, null, CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER | CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER, IID_WebBrowser2, ie);

dispDoc.QueryInterface(IHTMLDocument2, doc);
dispDoc.Release()
doc.Write(html); 
doc.Close();
doc.Release();
ie.Visible = true;
ie.Release();


Update
Commenter asked on the ieblog entry Testing sites with Browser Mode vs. Doc Mode:

Can we get a description of how the document mode is determined when the HTML content is within an embedded webcontrol? Seems to be that the document mode is choosen differently - maybe for compatibility reasons?

MarkSil [MSFT] responded:

@Thomas: Thanks for raising that question. The WebBrowser Control determines the doc mode the same way that IE does because it contains the same web platform (e.g. there is one shared mshtml.dll across IE and WebBrowser Control hosts). The WebBrowser Control does default to the Compatibility View browser mode, which means that the default doc mode is IE7. Here is a blog post with more detail on this: blogs.msdn.com/.../more-ie8-extensibility-improvements.aspx.

To which Thomas responded:

@MarcSil (re: WebBrowser Control)
The problem with using registry entries to select document mode for WebControl is that it applies to the application as a whole. I write plugins for Google SketchUp where you have WebDialog windows to create UIs - it's just a WebBrowser control in a window. But that leads to problems as I want to force a document mode for my instance of the WebBrowser control, not for all of SU's WebBrowser controls as a whole.
So, my question is: how do you control the document mode per instance for a WebBrowser control?

95,webdriver.FirefoxProfile(): Is it possible to use a profile without making a copy of it?,"
As the documentation states, you can call webdriver.FirefoxProfile() with the optional argument of profile_directory to point to the directory of a specific profile you want the browser to use. I noticed it was taking a long time to run this command, so when I looked into the code, it looked like it was copying the specified profile Problem is, it takes an extremely long time for the profile to copy (something like >30 minutes, didn't have the patience to wait for it to finish.)
I'm using a hybrid of userscripts and selenium to do some automation for me, so to setup a new profile every single time I want to test out my code would be burdensome.
Is the only way to change this behaviour to edit the firefox_profile.py itself (if so, what would be the best way to go about it?)?

103,Automating telnet session using Bash scripts,"
I am working on automating some telnet related tasks, using Bash scripts.
Once automated, there will be no interaction of the user with telnet (that is, the script will be totally automated).
The scripts looks something like this:
# execute some commands on the local system
# access a remote system with an IP address: 10.1.1.1 (for example)

telnet 10.1.1.1

# execute some commands on the remote system
# log all the activity (in a file) on the local system
# exit telnet
# continue with executing the rest of the script

There are two problems I am facing here:

How to execute the commands on the remote system from the script (without human interaction)?
From my experience with some test code, I was able to deduce that when telnet 10.1.1.1 is executed, telnet goes into an interactive session and the subsequent lines of code in the script are executed on the local system. How can I run the lines of code on the remote system rather than on the local one?

I am unable to get a log file for the activity in the telnet session on the local system. The stdout redirect I used makes a copy on the remote system (I do not want to perform a copy operation to copy the log to the local system). How can I achieve this functionality?

XPath is SO much more durable than CSS.  The CSS on any given UI is subject to change almost weekly on some projects/features.  This make the tests extremely brittle and prone to being broken regularly.
Is it because most new test writers don't want to learn about anything XPath and wish to stick to the basics? CSS selectors look prettier than XPath syntax? Please convince me. thanks.

then the file saves and Excel quits. Otherwise the file saves but Excel is left running as a process. The next time this code runs it creates a new instance and they eventually build up.

Update
No matter what I try, the 'clean' method or the 'ugly' method (see answers below), the excel instance still hangs around as soon as this line is hit:
wSheet.Cells[iRowCount, 1] = data[""fullname""].ToString();

If I comment that line out (and the other similar ones below it, obviously) the Excel app exits gracefully. As soon as one line per above is uncommented, Excel sticks around.
I think I'm going to have to check if there's a running instance prior to assigning the xl variable and hook into that instead. I forgot to mention that this is a windows service, but that shouldn't matter, should it?

128,VBA Internet Explorer wait for web page to load,"
I know questions like this have been asked before, but mine is a bit different and has been fairly troubling.  What I'm dealing with is a web page with a form with a few events that load more of the page when certain items in input boxes are filled out.  When these events fire the page loads again, but remains at the same URL with the same nameprop.  I've been using the following types of methods both seperately and strung together to handle waiting for the page to load, but sometimes the VBA still manages to continue executing and set the HTMLDocument variable to a page without the appropriate information on it causing the macro to debug.  Here are the kinds of things I've been trying so far:
While IE.Busy
    DoEvents
Wend

Do Until IE.statusText = ""Done""
    DoEvents
Loop

Do Until IE.readyState = 4
    DoEvents
Loop

I've even attempted to place these events into a loop like the following, but it didn't quite work because the lastModified property only returns a value down to the second and the macro spins through the fields fast enough that it is returning a new page in the same second:
Do Until IE.statusText = ""Done"" And IE.Busy = False And IE.ReadyState = 4 _
And IE.document.lastModified > LastModified ----or---- IE.document.nameprop = _
""some known and expected name prop here""
    While IE.Busy
        DoEvents
    Wend
    Do Until IE.statusText = ""Done""
        DoEvents
    Loop
    Do Until IE.readyState = 4
        DoEvents
    Loop
Loop

Even that fails to wait long enough to set the HTMLDocument object leading to a debug.  I've contemplated setting the next input element and checking that for nothing to further the code, but even that wouldn't be successful 100% of the time because generally the Input elements exist in the HTML but are hidden until the appropriate event is fired, which wouldn't be a problem but they don't load their possible selections until after the event is fired.  It might be an odd page.
Anyway... not sure what else to add.  If there is something else that might be helpful to see just ask.  I guess what I'm looking for is a way to get VBA to wait until IE knows another page isn't on it's way.  It seems to load a few times before it is completely done.
So... Anyone have any ideas?
EDIT:  Found a few new things to try.  Still, no dice.  It was suggested that I add these attempts.  Here is the code, for some reason the VBE and excel instance become non-responsive when using this approach after firing an event that should populate the options on the select element... thinking about trying xml... here is the code:
intCounter = 0
Do until intCounter > 2
    Do Until IE.Busy = False: DoEvents: Loop
    Do Until IE.ReadyState = 4: DoEvents: Loop
    Set HTMLDoc = IE.Document
    Do Until HTMLDoc.ReadyState = ""complete""
    Set HTMLSelect = HTMLDoc.getElementById(""ctl00$ctl00$MainContent$ChildMainContent$ddlEmployeeBranchCodes"")
    intCounter = 0
    For each Opt in HTMLSelect
        intCounter = intCounter + 1
    Next Opt
Loop

Based on what I can see happening on the web page, I know that it is somewhere in this loop that the VBE and Excel become non-responsive.  
Hope that helps... I know it didn't help me... Drats.
EDIT:  Just thought I'd add this.  When it comes to automating a web page, for the most part, I no longer use IE.  I've found it's much better, and sidesteps this issue of async stuff entirely, to simply perform the posts and gets yourself.  May not be the best solution depending on what you're trying to do, but it works pretty reliably if you look at the traffic closely and parameterize things well.

while(true){

Also on the computer I have some AHK scripts and other stuff that manipulate the mouse but not sure if that has anything to do with it.

I'm looking to automate some web interactions, namely periodic download of files from a secure website. This basically involves entering my username/password and navigating to the appropriate URL.
I tried simple scripting in Python, followed by more sophisticated scripting, only to discover this particular website is using some obnoxious javascript and flash based mechanism for login, rendering my methods useless. 
I then tried HTMLUnit, but that doesn't seem to want to work either. I suspect use of Flash is the issue.
I don't really want to think about it any more, so I'm leaning towards scripting an actual browser to log in and grab the file I need. 
Requirements are:

Run on linux server (ie. no X running). If I really need to have X I can make that happen, but I won't be happy.
Be reliable. I want to start this thing and never think about it again.
Be scriptable. Nothing too sophisticated, but I should be able to tell the browser the various steps to take and pages to visit.

Are there any good toolkits for a headless, X-less scriptable browser? Have you tried something like this and if so do you have any words of wisdom?

            }
        }

        web_BrowserIE.DocumentCompleted -= fillup_LoadCompleted;        
    }

        webbrowserIE.DocumentCompleted -= click_LoadCompleted;
        webbrowserIE.DocumentCompleted += fillup_LoadCompleted;
    }

        webbrowserIE.Document.GetElementById(""login_login"").SetAttribute(""value"", myUserName);
        webbrowserIE.Document.GetElementById(""login_password"").SetAttribute(""value"", myPassword);

        {
            if (el.InnerText == ""Login"")

136,Evaluate javascript on a local html file (without browser),"

Now, I am at what I would hope is my final roadblock: Part of the form I need to submit seems to be output of a JavaScript function :| and lo and behold... Mechanize does not support javascript. I don't want to emulate the javascript functionality myself in python because I would ideally like a reusable solution...

Adding invisible links (possibly marked as rel=""nofollow""?),

style=""display: none;"" on link or parent container
placed underneath another element with higher z-index


detect who doesn't understand CaPiTaLiSaTioN,
detect who tries to post replies but always fail the Captcha.
detect GET requests to POST-only resources
detect interval between requests
detect order of pages requested
detect who (consistently) requests HTTPS resources over HTTP
detect who does not request image file (this in combination with a list of user-agents of known image capable browsers works surprisingly nice)

Some traps would be triggered by both 'good' and 'bad' bots.
you could combine those with a whitelist:

It trigger a trap
It request robots.txt?
It doest not trigger another trap because it obeyed robots.txt

One other important thing here is:
Please consider blind people using a screen readers: give people a way to contact you, or solve a (non-image) Captcha to continue browsing.
What methods are there to automatically detect the web crawlers trying to mask themselves as normal human visitors.
The question is not: How do I catch every crawler. The question is: How can I maximize the chance of detecting a crawler.
Some spiders are really good, and actually parse and understand HTML, xhtml, CSS JavaScript, VBScript etc...
I have no illusions: I won't be able to beat them.
You would however be surprised how stupid some crawlers are. With the best example  of stupidity (in my opinion) being: cast all URLs to lower case before requesting them.
And then there is a whole bunch of crawlers that are just 'not good enough' to avoid the various trapdoors.

143,Apache HTTPClient throws java.net.SocketException: Connection reset for many domains,"
I'm creating a (well behaved) web spider and I notice that some servers are causing Apache HttpClient to give me a SocketException -- specifically:
java.net.SocketException: Connection reset

The code that causes this is:
// Execute the request
HttpResponse response; 
try {
    response = httpclient.execute(httpget); //httpclient is of type HttpClient
} catch (NullPointerException e) {
    return;//deep down in apache http sometimes throws a null pointer...  
}

For most servers it's just fine.  But for others, it immediately throws a SocketException.
Example of site that causes immediate SocketException: http://www.bhphotovideo.com/
Works great (as do most websites): http://www.google.com/
Now, as you can see, www.bhphotovideo.com loads fine in a web browser.  It also loads fine when I don't use Apache's HTTP Client.  (Code like this:)
 HttpURLConnection c = (HttpURLConnection)url.openConnection();  
 BufferedInputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(c.getInputStream());  
 Reader r = new InputStreamReader(in);     

 int i;  
 while ((i = r.read()) != -1) {  
      source.append((char) i);  
 }  

So, why don't I just use this code instead?  Well there are some key features in Apache's HTTP Client that I need to use.
Does anyone know what causes some servers to cause this exception?
Research so far:

Problem occurs on my local Mac dev machines AND an AWS EC2 Instance, so it's not a local firewall.
It seems the error isn't caused by the remote machine because the exception doesn't say ""by peer""
This stack overflow seems relavent java.net.SocketException: Connection reset but the answers don't show why this would happen only from Apache HTTP Client and not other approaches.

Bonus question: I'm doing a fair amount of crawling with this system.  Is there generally a better Java class for this other than Apache HTTP Client?  I've found a number of issues (such as the NullPointerException I have to catch in the code above).  It seems that HTTPClient is very picky about server communications -- more picky than I'd like for a crawler that can't just break when a server doesn't behave.
Thanks all! 
Solution
Honestly, I don't have a perfect solution, but it works, so that's good enough for me.
As pointed out by oleg below, Bixo has created a crawler that customizes HttpClient to be more forgiving to servers.  To ""get around"" the issue more than fix it, I just used SimpleHttpFetcher provided by Bixo here:
(linked removed - SO thinks I'm a spammer, so you'll have to google it yourself)
SimpleHttpFetcher fetch = new SimpleHttpFetcher(new UserAgent(""botname"",""contact@yourcompany.com"",""ENTER URL""));
try {
    FetchedResult result = fetch.fetch(""ENTER URL"");
    System.out.println(new String(result.getContent()));
} catch (BaseFetchException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

The down side to this solution is that there are a lot of dependencies for Bixo -- so this may not be a good work around for everyone.  However, you can always just work through their use of DefaultHttpClient and see how they instantiated it to get it to work.  I decided to use the whole class because it handles some things for me, like automatic redirect following (and reporting the final destination url) that are helpful.
Thanks for the help all.
Edit: TinyBixo
Hi all.  So, I loved how Bixo worked, but didn't like that it had so many dependencies (including all of Hadoop).  So, I created a vastly simplified Bixo, without all the dependencies.  If you're running into the problems above, I would recommend using it (and feel free to make pull requests if you'd like to update it!)

146,Breaking out of a Protractor .filter() or .map() loop,"
I'm using Protractor and cucumber framework; how do I break out of a .filter or .map loop? I do not want to continue to iterate further if I found a match!
Page.prototype.getElementByKey = function (key) {
      var foundElement = null;
      return someElement.all(by.css('.someClass')).map(function (rawItem, index) {
        var itemObject = new ItemObjectClass(rawItem);
        return itemObject.getItemKey().then(function (foundItemKey) {
          var matched = String(foundItemKey).trim() === String(key).trim();

         console.log(' Matched: { ' + matched + ' }  index {'+index+'}');
          //if we have a match break out of the .filter function
          if (matched) {
            foundElement = itemObject;
            throw new Error(""Just our way of breaking out of .filter() above"");
          }
        });
      }).then(function () {
        //callback
        throw new Error('\n!!!!!Callback should not be called; 
       this means that we could not find an element that matched the passed in key above');
      }, function (error) {
        //error
        console.log('\n*******************errorCallback was called; '+error);
        return foundElement;
      });
    };

The above code finds the element but continues to iterate until the end instead of stopping when there's a match and breaking out by calling the errorCallback function. 
Given that .map function returns ""a promise that resolves to an array of values returned by the map function"" http://www.protractortest.org/#/api?view=ElementArrayFinder.prototype.map, I'm taking advantage of the fact that a promise will call its errCallback if the promise cannot be resolved. 
By throwing an a fake error, the errorCallback should be called and thereby break out of the .map loop.
Unfortunately, it successfully throws the error but continues with the loop instead of breaking out. I know that because when I

console.log(""boolean ""+matched+"" and index ""+index);

I get this: 
matched: false index: 0
matched: false index: 1
matched: true index 2 //it should have stopped here since matched = true
matched false index 3 // this should NOT have printed

so breaking out isn't working any ideas?

title = soup.find('td', text = re.compile(ur'Fixed text:(.*)', re.DOTALL), attrs = {'class': 'pos'})
self.response.out.write(str(title.string).decode('utf8'))

151,Spider a Website and Return URLs Only,"
I'm looking for a way to pseudo-spider a website. The key is that I don't actually want the content, but rather a simple list of URIs. I can get reasonably close to this idea with Wget using the --spider option, but when piping that output through a grep, I can't seem to find the right magic to make it work:
wget --spider --force-html -r -l1 http://somesite.com | grep 'Saving to:'

The grep filter seems to have absolutely no affect on the wget output. Have I got something wrong or is there another tool I should try that's more geared towards providing this kind of limited result set?
UPDATE
So I just found out offline that, by default, wget writes to stderr. I missed that in the man pages (in fact, I still haven't found it if it's in there). Once I piped the return to stdout, I got closer to what I need:
wget --spider --force-html -r -l1 http://somesite.com 2>&1 | grep 'Saving to:'

I'd still be interested in other/better means for doing this kind of thing, if any exist.

152,how to filter duplicate requests based on url in scrapy,"
I am writing a crawler for a website using scrapy with CrawlSpider.
Scrapy provides an in-built duplicate-request filter which filters duplicate requests based on urls. Also, I can filter requests using rules member of CrawlSpider. 
What I want to do is to filter requests like:
http:://www.abc.com/p/xyz.html?id=1234&refer=5678

If I have already visited
http:://www.abc.com/p/xyz.html?id=1234&refer=4567


NOTE: refer is a parameter that doesn't affect the response I get, so I don't care if the value of that parameter changes.

Now, if I have a set which accumulates all ids I could ignore it in my callback function parse_item (that's my callback function) to achieve this functionality.
But that would mean I am still at least fetching that page, when I don't need to.
So what is the way in which I can tell scrapy that it shouldn't send a particular request based on the url?

154,Scrapy Linkextractor duplicating(?),"
I have the crawler implemented as below.
It is working and it would go through sites regulated under the link extractor.
Basically what I am trying to do is to extract information from different places in the page:
- href and text() under the class 'news' ( if exists)
- image url under the class 'think block' ( if exists)
I have three problems for my scrapy:
1) duplicating linkextractor
It seems that it will duplicate processed page.  ( I check against the export file and found that the same ~.img appeared many times while it is hardly possible)
And the fact is , for every page in the website, there are hyperlinks at the bottom that facilitate users to direct to the topic they are interested in, while my objective is to extract information from the topic's page ( here listed several passages's title under the same topic ) and the images found within a passage's page( you can arrive to the passage's page by clicking on the passage's title found at topic page).
I suspect link extractor would loop the same page over again in this case.
( maybe solve with depth_limit?)
2) Improving parse_item
I think it is quite not efficient for parse_item. How could I improve it? I need to extract information from different places in the web ( for sure it only extracts if  it exists).Beside, it looks like that the parse_item could only progress HkejImage but not HkejItem (again I checked with the output file). How should I tackle this?
3) I need the spiders to be able to read Chinese.
I am crawling a site in HK and it would be essential to be capable to read Chinese.

$url = urldecode($url);
$url = str_replace("" "",""%20"",$url);

echo ""<a class='urlmax'>"".$_GET['title'].""</a>"";

9 times out of 10 this works just fine, however we are occasionally seeing what looks to be a race condition. My suspicion is that the loop starts when only one of the windows is open and while its entering the information the second one opens and steals focus; after this it just hangs indefinitely.
What I'm wondering is if there is any method to get all of the window handles for a given caption, so that we can wait until there are 2 before starting the loop.

175,Close a scrapy spider when a condition is met and return the output object,"
I have made a spider to get reviews from a page like this here using scrapy. I want product reviews only till a certain date(2nd July 2016 in this case). I want to close my spider as soon as the review date goes earlier than the given date and return the items list.
Spider is working well but my problem is that i am not able to close my spider if the condition is met..if i raise an exception, spider closes without returning anything.

176,selenium implicitly wait doesn't work,"
This is the first time I use selenium and headless browser as I want to crawl some web page using ajax tech.
The effect is great, but for some case it takes too much time to load the whole page(especially when some resource is unavailable),so I have to set a time out for the selenium.
First of all I tried set_page_load_timeout() and set_script_timeout(),but when I set these timeouts, I won't get any page source if the page doesn't load completely, as the codes below:
driver = webdriver.Chrome(chrome_options=options)
driver.set_page_load_timeout(5)
driver.set_script_timeout(5)
try:
    driver.get(url)
except Exception:
    driver.execute_script('window.stop()')

print driver.page_source.encode('utf-8')  # raise TimeoutException this line.

so I try to using Implicitly Wait and Conditional Wait, like this:
driver = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_options=options, executable_path=path)
print(""Firefox Headless Browser Invoked"")
wait = WebDriverWait(driver, timeout=10)
driver.implicitly_wait(2)
start = time.time()
driver.get(url)
end = time.time()
print 'time used: %s s' % str(end - start)
try:
    WebDriverWait(driver, 2, 0.5).until(expected.presence_of_element_located((By.TAG_NAME, 'body')))
    print driver.find_element_by_tag_name('body').text
except Exception:
    driver.execute_script('window.stop()')

This time I got the content that I want.However,it takes a very long time(40+ seconds),that means the timeout I set for 2 seconds doesn't work at all.
In my view, it seems like the driver.get() call ends until the browser stop loading the page, only after that the codes below can work, and you can not kill the get() call or you'll get nothing.
But this is very different from the selenium docs, I REALLY wonder where is the mistake.
environment: OSX 10.12, selenium 3.0.9 with FireFox & GoogleChrome Headless(both latest version.)
--- update ----
Thanks for help.I change the code as below, using WebDriverWait() alone, but there still exist cases that the call last for a very long time, far more than the timeout that I set.
Wonder if I can stop the page load immediately as the time is out?
driver = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_options=options, executable_path=path)
print(""Firefox Headless Browser Invoked"")
start = time.time()
driver.get('url')
end = time.time()
print 'time used: %s s' % str(end - start)
try:
    WebDriverWait(driver, 2, 0.5).until(expected.presence_of_element_located((By.TAG_NAME, 'body')))
    print driver.find_element_by_tag_name('body').text
except Exception:
    driver.execute_script('window.stop()')
driver.quit()

Here is a terminal output in test:
Firefox Headless Browser Invoked
time used: 44.6049938202 s

according to the code this means the driver.get() call takes 44 seconds to finish call, which is unexpected,I wonder if I misunderstood the behavior of the headless browsers?

Closed 6 years ago.



I'm sure my problem is based on a lack of understanding of asynch programming in node.js but here goes.
For example: I have a list of links I want to crawl. When each asynch request returns I want to know which URL it is for. But, presumably because of race conditions, each request returns with the URL set to the last value in the list.
var links = ['http://google.com', 'http://yahoo.com'];
for (link in links) {
    var url = links[link];
    require('request')(url, function() {
        console.log(url);
    });
}

Expected output:
http://google.com
http://yahoo.com

Actual output:
http://yahoo.com
http://yahoo.com

So my question is either:

How do I pass url (by value) to the call back function? OR
What is the proper way of chaining the HTTP requests so they run sequentially? OR
Something else I'm missing?

PS: For 1. I don't want a solution which examines the callback's parameters but a general way of a callback knowing about variables 'from above'.

183,How to print every executed line in GDB automatically until a given breakpoint is reached?,"
I would like to be able to set a breakpoint in GDB, and have it run to that point - and in the process, print out lines it has ""stepped through"".
Here is an example, based on this simple file with a main and a function, and two breakpoints for each: 
$ cat > test.c <<EOF
#include ""stdio.h""

int count=0;

void doFunction(void) {
  // two steps forward
  count += 2;
  // one step back
  count--;
}

int main(void) {
  // some pointless init commands;
  count = 1;
  count += 2;
  count = 0;
  //main loop
  while(1) {
    doFunction();
    printf(""%d\n"", count);
  }
}
EOF

$ gcc -g -Wall test.c -o test.exe
$ chmod +x test.exe
$ gdb -se test.exe
...
Reading symbols from /path/to/test.exe...done.
(gdb) b main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x80483ec: file test.c, line 14.
(gdb) b doFunction
Breakpoint 2 at 0x80483c7: file test.c, line 7.

To start the session, I need to run (r) the program, which will then stop at first breakpoint (main):
(gdb) r
Starting program: /path/to/test.exe 

Breakpoint 1, main () at test.c:14
14    count = 1;
(gdb) 

At this point - I can, for instance, hit continue (c); and the process will run through, not outputing anything, and break at the requested line: 
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 2, doFunction () at test.c:7
7     count += 2;
(gdb)

On the other hand, instead of continue - I can go line by line, either by using step (s) or next (n); for instance:
14    count = 1;
(gdb) n
15    count += 2;
(gdb) s
16    count = 0;
(gdb) s
19      doFunction();
(gdb) s

Breakpoint 2, doFunction () at test.c:7
7     count += 2;
(gdb) s
9     count--;
(gdb) s
10  }
(gdb) s

20      printf(""%d\n"", count);

21    }
(gdb) n
19      doFunction();
(gdb) n

Breakpoint 2, doFunction () at test.c:7
7     count += 2;
(gdb) 

Anyways, I am aware that I can keep Enter pressed, and the last entered command (step or next) will repeat (left a bit longer session in the second case, to show that 'next' remains on same level, 'step' steps inside the functions being called). However, as it can be seen, depending on whether step or next runs, it may take a while until a result is reached - and so, I don't want to sit for 10 minutes with my hand stuck on the Enter button :) 
So, my question is - can I somehow instruct gdb to run to 'breakpoint 2' without further user intervention - while printing out the lines it goes through, as if step (or next) was pressed?

184,python-pptx - How to replace keyword across multiple runs?,"
I have two PPTs (File1.pptx and File2.pptx) in which I have the below 2 lines
XX NOV 2021, Time: xx:xx 鈥?xx:xx hrs (90mins)
FY21/22 / FY22/23

I wish to replace like below
a) NOV 2021 as NOV 2022.
b) FY21/22 / FY22/23 as FY21/22 or FY22/23.
But the problem is my replacement works in File1.pptx but it doesn't work in File2.pptx.
When I printed the run text, I was able to see that they are represented differently in two slides.
def replace_text(replacements:dict,shapes:list):
    for shape in shapes:
        for match, replacement in replacements.items():
            if shape.has_text_frame:
                if (shape.text.find(match)) != -1:
                    text_frame = shape.text_frame
                    for paragraph in text_frame.paragraphs:
                        for run in paragraph.runs:
                            cur_text = run.text
                            print(cur_text)
                            print(""---"")
                            new_text = cur_text.replace(str(match), str(replacement))
                            run.text = new_text

In File1.pptx, the cur_text looks like below (for 1st keyword). So, my replace works (as it contains the keyword that I am looking for)

But in File2.pptx, the cur_text looks like below (for 1st keyword). So, replace doesn't work (because the cur_text doesn't match with my search term)

The same issue happens for 2nd keyword as well which is FY21/22 / FY22/23.
The problem is the split keyword could be in previous or next run from current run (with no pattern). So, we should be able to compare a search term with previous run term (along with current term as well). Then a match can be found (like Nov 2021) and be replaced.
This issue happens for only 10% of the search terms (and not for all of my search terms) but scary to live with this issue because if the % increases, we may have to do a lot of manual work. How do we avoid this and code correctly?
How do we get/extract/find/identify the word that we are looking for across multiple runs (when they are indeed present) like CTRL+F and replace it with desired keyword?
Any help please?
UPDATE - Incorrect replacements based on matching
Before replacement

After replacement

187,Scraping in Python - Preventing IP ban,"
I am using Python to scrape pages. Until now I didn't have any complicated issues.
The site that I'm trying to scrape uses a lot of security checks and have some mechanism to prevent scraping. 
Using Requests and lxml I was able to scrape about 100-150 pages before getting banned by IP. Sometimes I even get ban on first request (new IP, not used before, different C block). I have tried with spoofing headers, randomize time between requests, still the same.
I have tried with Selenium and I got much better results. With Selenium I was able to scrape about 600-650 pages before getting banned. Here I have also tried to randomize requests (between 3-5 seconds, and make time.sleep(300) call on every 300th request). Despite that, Im getting banned.
From here I can conclude that site have some mechanism where they ban IP if it requested more than X pages in one open browser session or something like that.
Based on your experience what else should I try?
Will closing and opening browser in Selenium help (for example after every 100th requests close and open browser). I was thinking about trying with proxies but there are about million of pages and it will be very expansive.

192,Interacting with multiple instances of an application in Coded UI,"
The scenario that I am facing is that I am trying to write a single test which will use Coded UI to interact with multiple instances of the same application, in this case Microsoft Excel. In other words, there will be multiple Excel workbooks open in multiple windows, and I need to be able to direct Coded UI to interact with a specific instance programatically. I initially thought this type of instance management would be a function of the ApplicationUnderTest class, but it is not obvious how this class would achieve this.
The interactions will involve the same UIMap for all instances (in fact, each instance will probably need multiple UIMaps, but for the sake of simplicity that can be ignored for this question unless it is significant to the answer).
A couple of solution approaches I'm already aware of:

Minimize and maximize the instances so only the one currently being used is visible at any given time. Ideally I'd like to avoid this. For one thing, it may eventually become a requirement that two windows are visible simultaneously during the tests.
Dynamically modify the search properties to always include some unique identifier every time the UI Map is accessed. I'm not sure what the best candidate for a search property would be here. 

Ideally I would like something more integrated into Coded UI than either of these options, though the latter would probably suffice if necessary. I would appreciate any direction on whether there are any other possible approaches.

I am stuck with a case where the need is to click on an icon after asserting inputs from the user. In case there were some unique identifiers, the thing was pretty simple like the use of:  rightOf('{}UniqueIdentifier').find('i').click() served the purpose.
Also working fine with: scroll('{}UniqueIdentifier').parent.children[4].click()
But in case the table contains repeated values nothing could be found unique to search for and click. For which the thought was to match entire row text where the last element is that icon which needs to be clicked OR any other method which suits this?
Table looks like this:-

Need to click on triple dot icon for- A2,P2,2,resolved. How can this be achieved using wildcard locators? I tried creating a list of elements and match it with user input list but failed doing so.

This question has been asked over and over again - and in-spite of trying all the hacks I still can't seem to figure out what's wrong.
I tried increasing the implicitly_wait to 30 (and even increased it upto 100) - yet it did not work. 
Use case -: I am trying to create a list that wil populate all the items in the page here, as a base case - and I intend to bind this to a mini-module that I already have with scrapy which has all (pages with similar web elements) crawled links - so essentially will be building the whole pipeline, post I am done with this.

Questions & comments: 

If you are answering this question - please mention why this specific ""find_element_by_link_text"" does not work. 
(Very Basic) In the GUI of my selenium IDE -> Show all available commands - why dont I see the css (find_element_by_css_selector) for all the web elements - is there a way to force feed an element to be read as a CSS selector ?
In case you suggest using some other locator - please mention if that will be consistent way to fetch elements, given (1) 
Does assert work to capture the exceptions and ""move on"" - since even after trying ""verify"" , ""assert"" loops, I still cant fetch this  ""find_element_by_link_text""
I tried using Xpath to build this ""element"" , but in the view Xpath (in firefox) - I see nothing, to clue why that happens (Of course I removed the namespace "":x"" )

Other things I tried apart from implicity_wait(30):
find_element_by_partial_link(鈥淭hinkpad鈥? and appending Unicode to this (wasn鈥檛 sure if it was reading the brackets ( , driver.find_element_by_link_text(u""Thinkpad Edge E530 (Black)"").text, still did not work.

210,Interact with other programs using Python,"
I'm having the idea of writing a program using Python which shall find a lyric of a song whose name I provided. I think the whole process should boil down to couple of things below. These are what I want the program to do when I run it:

prompt me to enter a name of a song
copy that name
open a web browser (google chrome for example)
paste that name in the address bar and find information about the song
open a page that contains the lyrics
copy that lyrics
run a text editor (like Microsoft Word for instance)
paste the lyrics
save the new text file with the name of the song

I am not asking for code, of course. I just want to know the concepts or ideas about how to use python to interact with other programs
To be more specific, I think I want to know, fox example, just how we point out where is the address bar in Google Chrome and tell python to paste the name there. Or how we tell python how to copy the lyrics as well as paste it into the Microsof Word's sheet then save it.
I've been reading (I'm still reading) several books on Python: Byte of python, Learn python the hard way, Python for dummies, Beginning Game Development with Python and Pygame. However, I found out that it seems like I only (or almost only) learn to creat programs that work on itself (I can't tell my program to do things I want with other programs that are already installed on my computer)
I know that my question somehow sounds rather silly, but I really want to know how it works, the way we tell Python to regconize that this part of the Google chrome browser is the address bar and that it should paste the name of the song in it. The whole idea of making python interact with another program is really really vague to me and I just 
extremely want to grasp that.

I'm going to be as absolutely verbose here as possible as I've run into a few solutions that didn't end up panning out. Please keep in mind that I don't know Javascript. I know basic HTML and CSS. I don't have any actual programming background but I'm trying to learn bit by bit by researching basic tasks like this. Please talk to me like I'm an idiot. Any lingo I throw around in this post I learned while researching this specific issue. I'm writing this userscript as a personal project and to share with some friends.
What I'm trying to do.
I'm trying to write a userscript for Chrome/Greasemonkey (Chrome is my target browser) that will click the Refresh button on the Battlefield 3 server browser. For those of you that don't know, Battlefield 3 uses a web site paired with a browser plugin for VOIP and actually launching the game via a server browser. The bulk of it seems to be fairly straight forward HTML arranged in tables.
The idea is that when viewing the main page for a server that is full, the script will click the Refresh button every three seconds or so until the page reports an open spot on the server, then stop the refresh loop and click the join server button. I've already got the part of the script running that polls the server current and maximum players then assigns them to their own variables.
At this point I'm trying to get a click to work in the console so I can actually put it to some use in my script and am having zero luck.
The code I'm trying to manipulate.
This is the div for the button that I'm trying to click pulled from the Chrome dev tools:
<div class=""serverguide-header-refresh-button alternate show""> 
<div type=""reset"" class=""common-button-medium-grey"">
<p style=""position: relative;"">
<a href=""/bf3/servers/show/c7088bdc-2806-4758-bf93-2106792b34d8/"">Refresh </a>
</p>
</div>
</div>

(That link is not static. It's a link to a specific server page)
What I've tried.
To actually find the button I'm using getElementsByClassName. It doesn't have a unique ID but the class is unique to that element on this particular page so getElementsByClassName(""serverguide-header-refresh-button"")[0] is pulling the proper div each time. It's getting the script to perform any actual action on the button that's the problem.
document.getElementsByClassName(""serverguide-header-refresh-button"")[0].click();

I now realize this didn't work because it's not a conventional submit button. I don't understand the specifics of the standard here but I get that it doesn't support the .click() method.
function addJQuery(callback) {
  var script = document.createElement(""script"");
  script.setAttribute(""src"", ""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js"");
  script.addEventListener('load', function() {
    var script = document.createElement(""script"");
    script.textContent = ""("" + callback.toString() + "")();"";
    document.body.appendChild(script);
  }, false);
  document.body.appendChild(script);
}

// the guts of this userscript
function main() {
  unsafeWindow.jQuery('.serverguide-header-refresh-button')[0].click();
}

// load jQuery and execute the main function
addJQuery(main);

This is simply unsafeWindow.jQuery('.serverguide-header-refresh-button').click(); wrapped in some code to load jQuery for userscripts. It was a bit I picked up elsewhere but was told it would only work if jQuery was loaded on the page. I figured it was worth a try. This is one of those I have no idea what I'm doing shots in the dark and it didn't work. I tried the same thing below with another snippet of jQuery code I picked up:
function addJQuery(callback) {
  var script = document.createElement(""script"");
  script.setAttribute(""src"", ""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js"");
  script.addEventListener('load', function() {
    var script = document.createElement(""script"");
    script.textContent = ""("" + callback.toString() + "")();"";
    document.body.appendChild(script);
  }, false);
  document.body.appendChild(script);
}

// the guts of this userscript
function main() {
   var evObj = document.createEvent('Events');
      evObj.initEvent(""click"", true, false);
      document.getElementsByClassName('serverguide-header-refresh-button')[0].dispatchEvent(evObj);
}

    // load jQuery and execute the main function
addJQuery(main);

Both of these return Undefined in the Chrome and Firebug consoles.
So, would anyone be so kind as to help me create a bit of code for this script to press the Refresh button on this page?

The Problem
I use a tool at work that lets me do queries and get back HTML tables of info. I do not have any kind of back-end access to it.
A lot of this info would be much more useful if I could put it into a spreadsheet for sorting, averaging, etc. How can I screen-scrape this data to a CSV file?
My First Idea
Since I know jQuery, I thought I might use it to strip out the table formatting onscreen, insert commas and line breaks, and just copy the whole mess into notepad and save as a CSV. Any better ideas?
The Solution
Yes, folks, it really was as easy as copying and pasting. Don't I feel silly.
Specifically, when I pasted into the spreadsheet, I had to select ""Paste Special"" and choose the format ""text."" Otherwise it tried to paste everything into a single cell, even if I highlighted the whole spreadsheet.

Specifically, I want to get at the two different types of data hidden in the CData statement. the first which is just text I'm pretty sure I can throw a regex at it and get what I need. For the second type, if i could drop the data that has html elements into it's own beautifulsoup, I can parse that. 
I'm just learning python and beautifulsoup, so I'm struggling to find the magical incantation that will give me just the CData by itself.

Greetings,
I've been toying with an idea for a new project and was wondering if anyone has any idea on how a service like Kayak.com is able to aggregate data from so many sources so quickly and accurately. More specifically, do you think Kayak.com is interacting with APIs or are they crawling/scraping airline and hotel websites in order to fulfill user requests? I know there isn't one right answer for this sort of thing but I'm curious to know what others think would be a good way to go about this. If it helps, pretend you are going to create kayak.com tomorrow ... where is your data coming from?

Do they have a built-in JavaScript engine? Or do they simple ignore all JavaScript generated content in the page (I guess quite unlikely). Do people use specific techniques for getting their content indexed which would otherwise be available through background AJAX requests to a normal Internet user?

227,"Save complete web page (incl css, images) using python/selenium","
I am using Python/Selenium to submit genetic sequences to an online database, and want to save the full page of results I get back. Below is the code that gets me to the results I want:
from selenium import webdriver

URL = 'https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastx&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&LINK_LOC=blasthome'
SEQUENCE = 'CCTAAACTATAGAAGGACAGCTCAAACACAAAGTTACCTAAACTATAGAAGGACAGCTCAAACACAAAGTTACCTAAACTATAGAAGGACAGCTCAAACACAAAGTTACCTAAACTATAGAAGGACAGCTCAAACACAAAGTTACCTAAACTATAGAAGGACA' #'GAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGA'
CHROME_WEBDRIVER_LOCATION = '/home/max/Downloads/chromedriver' # update this for your machine

# open page with selenium
# (first need to download Chrome webdriver, or a firefox webdriver, etc)
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=CHROME_WEBDRIVER_LOCATION)
driver.get(URL)
time.sleep(5)

# enter sequence into the query field and hit 'blast' button to search
seq_query_field = driver.find_element_by_id(""seq"")
seq_query_field.send_keys(SEQUENCE)

blast_button = driver.find_element_by_id(""b1"")
blast_button.click()
time.sleep(60)

At that point I have a page that I can manually click ""save as,"" and get a local file (with a corresponding folder of image/js assets) that lets me view the whole returned page locally (minus content which is generated dynamically from scrolling down the page, which is fine). I assumed there would be a simple way to mimic this 'save as' function in python/selenium but haven't found one. The code to save the page below just saves html, and does not leave me with a local file that looks like it does in the web browser, with images, etc.
content = driver.page_source
with open('webpage.html', 'w') as f:
    f.write(content)

I've also found this question/answer on SO, but the accepted answer just brings up the 'save as' box, and does not provide a way to click it (as two commenters point out)
Is there a simple way to 'save [full page] as' using python? Ideally I'd prefer an answer using selenium since selenium makes the crawling part so straightforward, but I'm open to using another library if there's a better tool for this job. Or maybe I just need to specify all of the images/tables I want to download in code, and there is no shortcut to emulating the right-click 'save as' functionality?
UPDATE - Follow up question for James' answer
So I ran James' code to generate a page.html (and associated files) and compared it to the html file I got from manually clicking save-as. The page.html saved via James' script is great and has everything I need, but when opened in a browser it also shows a lot of extra formatting text that's hidden in the manually save'd page. See attached screenshot (manually saved page on the left, script-saved page with extra formatting text shown on right). 

This is especially surprising to me because the raw html of the page saved by James' script seems to indicate those fields should still be hidden. See e.g. the html below, which appears the same in both files, but the text at issue only appears in the browser-rendered page on the one saved by James' script:
<p class=""helpbox ui-ncbitoggler-slave ui-ncbitoggler"" id=""hlp1"" aria-hidden=""true"">
These options control formatting of alignments in results pages. The
default is HTML, but other formats (including plain text) are available.
PSSM and PssmWithParameters are representations of Position Specific Scoring Matrices and are only available for PSI-BLAST. 
The Advanced view option allows the database descriptions to be sorted by various indices in a table.

230,Send parallel requests but only one per host with HttpClient and Polly to gracefully handle 429 responses,"
Intro:
I am building a single-node web crawler to simply validate URLs are 200 OK in a .NET Core console application. I have a collection of URLs at different hosts to which I am sending requests with HttpClient. I am fairly new to using Polly and TPL Dataflow.
Requirements:

I want to support sending multiple HTTP requests in parallel with a
configurable MaxDegreeOfParallelism.
I want to limit the number of parallel requests to any given host to 1 (or configurable). This is in order to gracefully handle per-host 429 TooManyRequests responses with a Polly policy. Alternatively, I could maybe use a Circuit Breaker to cancel concurrent requests to the same host on receipt of one 429 response and then proceed one-at-a-time to that specific host?
I am perfectly fine with not using TPL Dataflow at all in favor of maybe using a Polly Bulkhead or some other mechanism for throttled parallel requests, but I am not sure what that configuration would look like in order to implement requirement #2.

Current Implementation:
My current implementation works, except that I often see that I'll have x parallel requests to the same host return 429 at about the same time... Then, they all pause for the retry policy... Then, they all slam the same host again at the same time often still receiving 429s. Even if I distribute multiple instances of the same host evenly throughout the queue, my URL collection is overweighted with a few specific hosts that still start generating 429s eventually.
After receiving a 429, I think I only want to send one concurrent request to that host going forward to respect the remote host and pursue 200s. 
Validator Method:
public async Task<int> GetValidCount(IEnumerable<Uri> urls, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var validator = new TransformBlock<Uri, bool>(
        async u => (await _httpClient.GetAsync(u, HttpCompletionOption.ResponseHeadersRead, cancellationToken)).IsSuccessStatusCode,
        new ExecutionDataflowBlockOptions {MaxDegreeOfParallelism = MaxDegreeOfParallelism}
    );
    foreach (var url in urls)
        await validator.SendAsync(url, cancellationToken);
    validator.Complete();
    var validUrlCount = 0;
    while (await validator.OutputAvailableAsync(cancellationToken))
    {
        if(await validator.ReceiveAsync(cancellationToken))
            validUrlCount++;
    }
    await validator.Completion;
    return validUrlCount;
}

The Polly policy applied to the HttpClient instance used in GetValidCount() above.
IAsyncPolicy<HttpResponseMessage> waitAndRetryTooManyRequests = Policy
    .HandleResult<HttpResponseMessage>(r => r.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.TooManyRequests)
    .WaitAndRetryAsync(3,
        (retryCount, response, context) =>
            response.Result?.Headers.RetryAfter.Delta ?? TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(120),
        async (response, timespan, retryCount, context) =>
        {
            // log stuff
        });

Fill in the fields in the new window, and click a few buttons.
After required actions are completed in the new Window, close the new window and move back to the main window.
Continue execution with the main window.

session <- html_session(""www.chase.com"")
form <- html_form(session)[[3]]

filledform <- set_values(form, `user_name` = user_name, `usr_password` = usr_password)
session <- submit_form(session, filledform)

At this point, I receive this error:
Error in names(submits)[[1]] : subscript out of bounds

How can I make this form submit?

250,Hide Email Address from Bots - Keep mailto:,"
tl;dr
Hide email address from bots without using scripts and maintain mailto: functionality. Method must also support screen-readers.

Summary

Email obfuscation without using scripts or contact forms

Email address needs to be completely visible to human viewers and maintain mailto: functionality

Email Address must not be in image form.

Email address must be ""completely"" hidden from spam-crawlers and spam-bots and any other harvester type



Desired Effect:

No scripts, please. There are no scripts used in the project and I'd like to keep it that way.

Email address is either displayed on the page or can be easily displayed after some sort of user interaction, like opening a modal.

The user can click on on the email address which in turn would trigger the mailto: functionality.

Clicking the email will open the user's email application.
In other words, mailto: functionality must work.

The email address in not visible or not identified as an email address to bots (This includes the page source)

I don't have an inbox that's full of spam



What does NOT Work

Adding a contact form - or anything similar - instead of the email address

I hate contact forms. I rarely fill up a contact form. If there's no email address, I look for a phone number, and if that's not there, I start looking for an alternative service. I would only fill up a contact form if I absolutely have to.

Replacing the address with an image of the address

This creates a HUGE disadvantage to someone using a screenreader (please remember the visually impaired in your future projects)
It also removes the mailto: functionality unless you make the image clickable and then add the mailto: functionality as the href for the link, but that defeats the purpose and now the email is visible to bots.

What might work:

Clever usage of pseudo-elements in CSS

Solutions that make use of base64 encoding

Breaking up the email address and spreading the parts across the document then putting them back together in a modal when the user clicks a button (This will probably involve multiple CSS classes and the usage of anchor tags)

Alterting html attributes via CSS


@MortezaAsadi gracefully brought up the possibility in the comments below. This is the link to the full - The article is from 2012:
What if We Could Use CSS to Alter HTML Attributes?

Other creative solutions that are beyond my scope of knowledge.

Does e-mail address obfuscation actually work?

(The selected answer to this SuperUser question is great and it presents a study of the amount of spam received by using different obfuscation methods.
It seems that manipulating the email address with CSS to make it rtl does work. This is the same method used in the first question I linked to in this section.
I am uncertain what effects adding mailto: functionality to the fix would have on the results.

There are also many other questions on SO which all have similar answers. I have not found anything that fits my desired effect


The Question:
Would it be possible to increase the efficiency (ie as little spam as possible) of the email obfuscation methods above by combining two or more of the fixes (or even adding new fixes) while:
A- Maintaining mailto: functionality; and
B- Supporting screen-readers

Many of the answers and comments below pose a very good question while indicating the impossibility of doing this without some sort of js
The question that's asked/implied is:

Why not use js?

The answer is that I am allergic to js
Joking aside though,
The three main reasons I asked this question are:

Contact forms are becoming more and more accepted as a replacement
for providing an email address - which they should not.

If it can be done without scripting then it should be done without
scripting.

Curiosity: (as I am in fact using one of the js fixes currently) I wanted to see if discussing the matter would lead to a better way of doing it.

I've been working on a web scraping project using Python to extract data from [YellowPage](https://github.com/sushil-rgb/YellowPage-scraper) and I wanted to share my experience and some tips for anyone else looking to do the same.

First, I used the popular library BeautifulSoup and Playwright to navigate and automate the website. The script asks user to enter a business name, location and number of pages to scrape and save it into an excel database accordingly. It extracts all the necessary data including emails as well. I feel I used lots of try and except clause, if someone has better approach them please free to share.

Another thing to watch out for is that the website structure can change frequently, so it's important to regularly check and update your code accordingly.

Overall, it was a fun and challenging project that taught me a lot about web scraping and working with dynamic websites.

2. Selects the data you really want. We give you variations of selections to choose from so you get exactly the rows you want.
3. Keeps your data on the cloud. Most web scrapers require you to download your data right away or pay to save your data online. Whatever you scrape is automatically saved so you can access it any day, anytime. Download formats in JSON & CSV.
4. Pagination Hell. Paginating simple table structures with next hyperlinks is easy. What is difficult for others is handling javascript buttons, single page apps and tricky actions. Some extensions only allow pagination on the cloud and charge for it.
5. Primary Keys. To prevent duplicate data, you can set a column as a primary key so that you only get fresh and updated data every time
6. Built for your team. You and others can scrape many websites, from different browsers & devices with a single source of truth.
7. Select once, run anytime. After you create a selection once, you or your team will never re-create it. Anytime you visit the same page, Mad Scraper checks for new data and updates.
8. It's SUPER simple to use. We tried 10 popular web scrapers and made this so much easier to use than all of them. A 1 minute tutorial is all you'll ever need. [https://madscraper.com/tutorial](https://madscraper.com/tutorial)
9. Built for developers. Web-hooks for fresh data and a JSON API link for your applications.
10. We'll listen to you. If you have any suggestion and it's a killer one, we'll work on it in a week or less!

278,Custom shortcuts to automate access AI on your Mac," 

Hello folks,

I'm always amazed by the power of GPT-3 and Open AI.

This post is a combination of both information and promotion, so please bear with me.

I've always wanted to use AI directly on my phone and computer, without having to go to OpenAI's playground or ChatGPT in the browser.

For that, I created a tiny Mac app called Elephas. I have shared the app in this group [in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/1027x84/using_gpt3_to_automate_content_repurposing_for/) as well and got some amazing feedback from the members :)

Since then many users have asked for the ability to add custom commands in the app, that they can use to invoke AI on their computer.

So I've just shipped a feature called ""Snippets"".

With this, **now you can assign custom shortcuts to OpenAI prompts and use them in your day-to-day workflow wherever necessary.**

This is how it works -

https://reddit.com/link/10eau6v/video/401eus15ilca1/player

 There are many more such utility features that can help you get the power of AI in your daily work.

You can get the app here - [Elephas](https://elephas.app/?ref=rAutomate-snippets)

You can try it out for FREE for 7 days.

Appreciate your feedback.

Do let me know any new features that you would like to see in the app.

It's crazy how versatile and powerful GPT-3 and Open AI are.

This post is a combination of both information and promotion, so please bear with me.

I got some great feedback and support from the members of this subreddit on [my last post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/z7sofx/using_gpt3_to_reply_to_automate_email_replies/) So sharing a post here again.

Many of our users had been asking for the ability to repurpose their existing blog and newsletter content into social media posts.

They are mostly busy content writers so this can be really useful to them in their day-to-day work.

So I tried a simple prompt - ""Summarize this for a tweet""

I took the content from an [OpenAI Blog](https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research/) and summarized it into a tweet.

&#x200B;

Next, I tried another prompt - ""Summarize this into a LinkedIn post""

And that worked alright as well.

&#x200B;

These prompts worked well so I decided to integrate them into our Mac app, and the users loved it.

Here is the final demo of how it works inside my app -

290,Are there any groups that are trying to help us prepare for the realities of automation?,"I've been playing around with ChatGPT for the past couple of weeks, and the potential is incredible. If you haven't tried it, I would highly recommend checking it out.

AI is improving rapidly, and there are very few jobs that I think are safe from being automated in the future. CGP Grey actually has an excellent video on the subject [Humans Need Not Apply](https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU).

I don't think that AI will be ready to replace humans tomorrow, but I firmly believe that it will be possible within my lifetime, if not within the next 10 years.

Having said that, I don't think that our society is ready for millions of people to lose their jobs. We don't have a way to take care of or support these people.

Sadly, I think the ""human"" solution to AI will be to ban it, and guarantee that people will get to keep their jobs.

Personally, I'd like to see us move in the opposite direction. Rather than guaranteeing jobs, I'd rather see us guarantee housing, healthcare, education and maybe a Universal Basic Income?

People would have the freedom to work if they wanted to, but they wouldn't be required to. They could take care of their families, pursue higher education or pursue their passions.

I can't pretend to be an expert or to know what the best way to structure that type of society would be.

But if I can, I want to use my energy to work towards it. What is the best way that I can advocate for this? Are there any groups working on this right now? How can I join them?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/zwx1dq/are_there_any_groups_that_are_trying_to_help_us/,automat

I’m looking to improve an internal process which currently consists of internal feedback being sent to someone’s email, who then has to manually enter this data into a spreadsheet. This seems like a pretty wasteful process and I also think the lack of anonymity deters colleagues from giving honest feedback. I want to instead collect this feedback from colleagues, ideally as an anonymous form which is easily pulled into a spreadsheet/database.

In my previous role we would’ve used MS Forms, which was great as it would automatically populate a spreadsheet. However we have really strict information governance rules which bans access to MS Forms due to overseas data storage. I have MS Access installed but have never used it before. Is it possible to collect data using MS access? 

I know that there are a lot of paid tools (e.g. surveymonkey) etc that could easily do this. However, I work in the public sector - budgets are very tight and it’s unlikely they would agree to fund this.

301,Chatbot requirements: technical and non-technical things to consider when everyone talks about ChatGPT,"Hi there! Just want to share some tips on how to craft the right chatbot when everyone talks about ChatGPT. First of all, a custom chatbot company or any chatbot platform that does custom integration can integrate your chatbot with ChatGPT instead of Dialogflow. So yeah, you can have an outstanding customer service chatbot that can handle other topics. However, the right question is should you? 

If you want a chatbot that does solve issues, not creates more, you must start with **the proper requirements.** Well-structured chatbot requirements lay the right foundation for your future chatbot development.  ChatGPT is just one of the options of how you can use AI and automation and may be not the best depending on your budget and goals. 

**Your chatbot requirements should include these steps:** 

\- defining the main problem you want to solve with the chatbot, 

\- measuring the impact of the problem,

\- determining the main chatbot goal/objective, 

\- understanding the market and target audience 

\- paying attention to the ""internal audience"" of the chatbot (the people or the team in your company who will be working with the chatbot).

Imagine you have found a problem when analyzing customer feedback. Most customers are saying the customer service response time is very long, and that's why they are giving you a low rating.

Your objective for the chatbot could sound like this: *""Decrease waiting time to 1 minute by the end of Q3 2023""* or *""Improve customer service response time from 18 minutes to 1 minute in the next Q""*

Having done this part, you can move to the next step, drafting the technical chatbot requirements. 

When working on the tech requirements, think about the following things:

* **Channels.** Which channels do you want your chatbot to be on? [Website](https://botscrew.com/blog/how-to-build-a-website-bot/), [WhatsApp](https://botscrew.com/blog/a-step-by-step-guide-to-create-chatbot-for-whatsapp-for-business/), Facebook, [SMS](https://botscrew.com/blog/sms-chatbot-a-complete-guide-for-business-use-cases/), [Instagram](https://botscrew.com/blog/instagram-chatbot/), email, etc.
* **Languages.** Which languages do you want your chatbot to “speak”? English, French, German, Arabian, etc? Should it speak one language or multiple?
* **Integrations.** Which tools do you need the chatbot to be integrated with? CRM, payment system, calendars, maps, custom internal tool, etc.
* **Chatbot's look and tone of voice.** If you have a specific vision of the chatbot, be sure to include this in the requirements. Also, if you have a very prominent brand personality and tone of voice, include that in your requirements as well.
* **KPIs and metrics.** Be sure to specify if you have any specific [metrics and KPIs](https://botscrew.com/blog/chatbot-metrics/) you have that you want the chatbot to meet.
* **Analytics and Dashboards.** Do you want the analytics to be in real-time? Are there any specific data you want to have on your dashboard like the number of users, automation rate, etc?
* **Technologies.** Do you have any specific technologies you want the chatbot to be built with? Is ChatGPT the right one for you? What are limitations of ChatGPT? 
* **NLP and AI.** Do you want the chatbot to have decision tree logic, Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), or Artificial intelligence (AI)?
* **Accessibility.** Do you need to meet some specific accessibility requirements like WCAG or ADA?
* **Users.** How many people from your team are going to use the chatbot? How many of your customers or conversations do you expect to use the chatbot?
* **Rich media**. Should the chatbot’s responses include text, hyperlinks, images, gifs, video, and PDF attachments?
* **Security.** Do you have any specific security measures and requirements you want the vendor or the chatbot to meet?
* **Hosting.** Where the chatbot and the user data will be hosted: on your own servers or on the cloud? If on the cloud, what will be the cloud service provider and server's location?

You can consider chatbot development and decide on chatbot vendors when you have a chatbot requirements outline.

303,AI + Customized templates to automate writing,"Hello folks, 

I'm a big fan of GPT-3 and Open AI.

This post is a combination of information and a bit of promotion, so please bear with me. 

You can use OpenAI to write most types of content like Blog posts, emails, ad copy etc.

But writing the prompts can be tedious, especially if you have to write the same type of content over and ove again.

You can solve this problem by using your own presets (common structure for every type of content)

 For example - there are 2 steps you need to follow to generate blog posts:

1. Step 1 - Define a common structure for all blog posts. A starting point you always use.
2. Step 2 - Pick a topic, and ask AI to generate a blog post on the topic that fits that structure.

You can do this for free in OpenAI's ""Playground""

I also included this feature in my Mac app. Here's what it looks like - 

https://reddit.com/link/zgzdx8/video/gmbhh5nhxv4a1/player

This is a massive time saver for creating any type of content. 

And the part that my users are loving the most is that they can define their own presets and truly make the AI work according to their wishes

Customized to their unique requirements  🤩

If you find this interesting, you might like my app.

There are many such tiny utilities I've built on top of OpenAI. (Including an AI keyboard for the iPhone)

I am looking to automate the billing entry process I am using.

&#x200B;

Currently, I just create an outlook appointment from an email message, correct the start time and add the vendor category.

&#x200B;

End of the month, I manually copy the message body into the billing system, then alter the date, hours, distance travelled, type of work before submitting the entry.

This process is taking forever to complete, and it makes my hands hurt repeating the same movements.

&#x200B;

I have been thinking of ways to automate this process, and looked into airtable, exporting the appointments to csv and trying macros. None of these really worked. 

&#x200B;

I know the billing system is written in PHP, however I do not manage or admin the billing environment and have no way to modify code.

It blows my mind that there are so many applications of GPT-3. This post is a combination of information and a bit of promotion, so please bear with me.

You can get a free OpenAI account and use their ""playground"" to test this.

Prompt:

>Reply to the following email in a professional tone.  
\[Actual email\]

You can replace the ""professional"" with different modes.

I narrowed down my research to these 5 open-source/free automation tools that you can use right away. Two of these are ready-to-use Zapier alternatives.

1- **Huginn** \- Huginn is a system for building agents that perform automated tasks for you. It’s like creating your own personal assistant, but without the need to learn a programming language.

Hosting: Self-hosted.

2- **automatisch** \- It is an automation tool that lets you easily create workflows in your web browser with no coding knowledge required. It's a user-friendly Zapier alternative.

Hosting: Self-hosted (for now).

3- **n8n** \- N8n is an open-source, no-code automation tool that lets you quickly create workflows with its drag-and-drop interface. It is based on nodes so you can connect anything to everything. The best Zapier alternative I've seen.

Hosting: Desktop, hosted, & self-hosted.

4- **Beehive** \- This is similar to how Huginn works. It's an event and agent system. Agents are triggered by events and perform their actions. There are multiple integrations (called Hives).

Hosting: Self-hosted.

5- **Power Automate** \- Microsoft's official no-code automation tool. It allows you to create flows for automating your tasks. It also has a desktop version (included in Windows 11). You can automate almost anything with it.

Hosting: Desktop and hosted (cloud flows - not free).

I have created some flows to automate Google Chrome using Power Automate, which works nicely. I am also using the n8n desktop version to connect multiple services I use.

324,PDF Form Data to MS Access,"Hello all!

I have a tedious task that I am hoping that the fine people of Reddit can help me automate or, at the very least, help me implement a more efficient process.

The existing process is as follows:

1. Employees from Company A fill out a PDF form after every client interaction
2. Company A employees save the form in a specific folder for Company A Data Entry Person
3. Company A Data Entry Person prints all forms from folder
4. Company A Data Entry Person enters all fields into an MS Access form controlled by Company B
5. Company A Data Entry Person writes the Unique ID assigned to the MS Access entry in the upper corner of the PDF form paper copy.
6. Company A Data Entry Person files a paper copy of the PDF form in a specific filing cabinet.
7. Company B provides a report to Company A that summarizes Company A's monthly entries into the MS Access DB.
8. Company A Data Entry Person compares Company B report with Company A numbers (gathered by hand counting specific fields on the paper copy of the PDF forms).
9. Company A Data Entry Person corrects or disputes any discrepancies and informs Company B Data Entry Person that they can rerun the number and provide a new report.

Some variables to consider are as follows:

* Company A does not have access to anything in the MS Access DB except the MS Access forms. This is a contracted job that pays based on what is input into MS Access DB.
* PDF forms get assigned a unique ID when submitted into MS Access. The ID gets written on a paper copy of the PDF form to associate what is input in MS Access. It is how Company A disputes discrepancies between Company A's and Company B's data. Ideally, the data matches between the two. However, they never do.

I will add that the PDF form originated as a Word document supplied by Company B. I am open to converting back to the Word version if it helps. I couldn't see that being the appropriate file type for this application.

I believe that is the most relevant information that I can provide but will provide more if needed. This process involves thousands of PDF forms, and entering them one by one into the MS Access DB is killing Company A's productivity. There has to be a better way.

Anyways I allways enjoyed scripting but at the end of the day those inputs require human interaction to activate....

\- Set up a script to use when the pattern is detected

342,Individual answers to Google-Form submissions - automatically,"This is crazy-amazing from where I sit: I can automate anything and get a UI for free: can use the G-Form not only to trigger, but to give immediate feedback to users. A different one for each submission. All it takes is plain G-Forms and a small Apps Script.

Here's how (stripped-down example):

1. Create a new form
2. turn on ""Make this a quiz"", set ""Release grades"" to ""Immediately after each submission""
3. can have ""Collect e-mails"" on or off, does not matter
4. Define the question, do *not* give an answer scheme. In my case, I have one called ""Variation"". Details on why the form needs to be a quiz: see below
5. Add yet another Question (non-mandatory!) called ""Feedback""
6. Edit the confirmation message to sth like ""Click 'View Score' to see the result""
7. In the 3-dots menu (upper right), open the script editor
8. Paste a variation of this script (you can determine feedback in the script, call a webhook like I do, look sth up in Sheets, whatever)

&#x200B;

    function myFunction(e) {
      var form = e.source;
      var response = e.response;
      var variationItem = form.getItems().find(item => item.getTitle() === 'Variation');
      var feedbackItem = form.getItems().find(item => item.getTitle() === 'Feedback');
      var variationResponseText = response.getGradableResponseForItem(variationItem).getResponse();
      var feedbackResponse = response.getGradableResponseForItem(feedbackItem);
      var didAddFeedback = false;
      if (!feedbackResponse.getFeedback()) {
        console.log('Adding feedback - chosen option: ' + variationResponseText);
        var webhookUrl = 'https://<whateveryourapi>?variation=' + encodeURIComponent(variationResponseText);
        var webhookResponse = UrlFetchApp.fetch(webhookUrl, {headers: {'X-Test': 'whatever'}}); // can also have API key headers, etc.
        var webhookBody = JSON.parse(webhookResponse.getContentText());
        feedbackResponse.setFeedback(FormApp.createFeedback().setText((webhookBody[variationResponseText].ordered ? ('We ordered ' + variationResponseText) : ('Sorry, could not order ' + variationResponseText + ': ' + webhookBody[variationResponseText].reason)) + '\nalso check out https://<yourwebsite>/<path>/' + encodeURIComponent(variationResponseText)).build());
        response.withItemGrade(feedbackResponse);
        didAddFeedback = true;
        console.log('Added feedback');
      } else {
        console.log('Feedback already there');
      }
      if (didAddFeedback) {
        console.log('New feedback - submitting');
        form.submitGrades([response]);
        console.log('New feedback - submitted');
      }
    }
    
    function installMe() { // (call manually so far; for addon: onInstall)
      var form = FormApp.openById('<your form ID>');
      ScriptApp.newTrigger('myFunction')
          .forForm(form)
          .onFormSubmit()
          .create();
    }

of course, you can customize / change this - it's just a (working) example to give you an idea

what it does:

* react on form submissions
* add a ""Quiz feedback"" to the one submission (*that* is why we needed it to be a quiz)
* make sure we only add feedback once (you'd have an endless loop otherwise)
* the feedback can contain links that are also rendered as links (can also contain pre-filled links to other G-Forms, even; same goes the confirm message, btw - just that the confirmation message is always the same for all users)

then,

1. run installMe() from the script console. This adds the trigger - it's also visible in the script console then. You'll be asked to authorize an insecure app. As the app is your own: do that
2. Try the form

344,Introducing the Basic Post-scarcity Map,"A society in which all basic human needs are provided at zero or very low cost without significant human work can be defined as basic post-scarcity.

Our civilization is getting close to the point where this is technically feasible.

To reach this milestone as soon as possible, we introduce here the Basic Post-scarcity Map project, an effort to map the current technological state of the art and to understand how far we are from a basic post-scarcity society. We are currently in alpha stage, and we are releasing early to gather feedback and collaborators.

This project is an attempt to provide unbiased answers to the following questions:

* What technological advancements are needed to reach basic post-scarcity?
* What is the state of the art, what resources are available to learn about it and who is currently working on improving it?
* How far are we from achieving basic post-scarcity and what are the bottlenecks?

To accomplish this, the basic idea is to build two maps: the first where we will deconstruct the basic needs needed to reach basic post-scarcity and the technical milestones needed to satisfy them with minimal human work at the minimum cost. The second in which we input and update the state of the art for each of the technical milestones.

References to the current state of the art and the resources needed to learn more about it are collected in separate pages forming a shared library.

This is an open source and collaborative project. All contributions are fact-based, with no projections, opinions, marketing or propaganda.

We believe that having a searchable and living assessment of the state of the art will enable people who want to work towards this goal to know what is needed, what is currently feasible and who is currently working on what.

We are aware of the many limitations of this approach and in particular we know that technical bottlenecks are not the only roadblocks to a basic post-scarcity civilization. However, we also think that it is not unreasonable to assume that reducing the cost and the manpower associated with fulfilling basic needs will make it easier for public and / or private actors to provide them as widely as possible.

Our goal is to make this project simple to contribute and update. At this stage we need help creating technical milestones. Domain experts are particularly welcome to shine light on the state of the art for the relevant milestones in their respective fields.Additionally, anyone with reference materials and / or knowledge of people currently involved in solving these problems can contribute by sharing their resources in the library.

The project is currently live at: [https://postscarcitymap.org/](https://postscarcitymap.org/)

You can make contributions directly to the library by editing the pages on our Gitlab repo: [https://gitlab.com/postscarcity/library/](https://gitlab.com/postscarcity/library/). At the moment the process of updating the tree is still pretty manual, but we plan to automate it more.

If you want to join us as part of the team and contribute regularly, we also have a Discord server: [https://discord.com/invite/vhc8EZkmEv](https://discord.com/invite/vhc8EZkmEv)

356,"Would anyone be willing to share details on how the UIPath pricing works? We are currently on Kofax RPA, I'd love to switch but I fear it will be much more expensive","Hey guys!

I'm the head of our department for Process Automation and one of the tools at our disposal is Kofax RPA. The business bought this in themselves (without telling IT) because a salesman sold it as fine for end users. Out of the 20 that trained, only 1 kept going and managed to DDOS the main system and so it got brought to IT's attention and came under their wing. I was then hired to work with it. I now work with this and several other systems to automate processes.

I love the ease of the software and you can spin up robots so easily. It's not cloud based, but we don't need to have any VMs because Kofax has a sort of emulated desktop where I can run excel, websites etc so we have 2 servers to run the bots as services and nothing else required. It's quick, it's easy.... but I HATE Kofax. 

There is no community, we've been asking for changes for 5 years and nothing happens. They don't offer cloud and our infrastructure if off-shored to TCS and it is always breaking down. The support is non existent. There is no training we had to learn by doing. When you ask their support or training teams, they come back going ""I don't know, we were not trained on this"". Upgrading the on prem software is week's of hard work and planning. The thing is great when it works but so flaky and not getting much investment.

I love the look of UI path but I fear it may end up waaaay more expensive. From what I've seen, you pay per month for the software but you also have to pay per month for each robot? We have 100+ processes running under Kofax and we are on their old licence - so we pay for the amoutn of ""resources"" we use at any given time. So we can run 100 robots just staggered across time so they're not all running at once. And some of the robots are big processes that can take up to a day but only go once a month, and other processes that take days but runs a couple of times a year. I can't pay per robot for a thing that rarely runs (but when it does, it enters 100s of thousands of rates into our system).

I'd love to hear from anybody willing to share a ballpark figure or even just confirm how it works for paying for robots and if I would be shelling out 1000s of dollars a year per process I automate. I will never get that past a business case!

If you look at the numbers right now, it makes a lot of sense because the costs of ChatGPT are current really, really low. But the terms and conditions of ChatGPT make it very clear that those costs can change, and I wonder if businesses might be walking into something of a trap.   


There's a lot of money to be made in automation, I know, I am an industrial automation engineer. But I expect that OpenAI (the developers of ChatGPT) knew exactly how much money their software could save companies when they developed that software, which is why they did it, and they don't intend to let the companies pocket the lion's share of those savings that they did they work to realize.   


So right now, companies can be early adopters and help ChatGPT build market share, train their AI, integrate it with other software packages and demonstrate it's ability to displace workers in the real world. But companies that go down this route and going to make ChatGPT essential to their business operation.

365,Logical flow of moes brand zigbee push button?,"So I got my first zigbee hub and switches.

Could anyone help a dummy out here?

Here's the situ:

*   3 smart bulbs exist in OFFICE.

*  In Tuya Smart, I've setup the following:  
     IF office(123) OFF and PIR Motion Detected  
     THEN execute automation officeON

I created the inverse of the above so the bulbs turn off when detected as on.

I've also tapped to set ""When ALL conditions are met""

I understand why it does not work:  I've created a loop.  When I press the button, it's triggering both routines.  

The issue is I don't know how to set it up as Tuya wants me to do it.  This would be 1000x easier if the execution simply toggled the power state rather than having to make routines to check the power state. 

Another oddity is in another office, it works exactly as it should but that office only has 1 bulb.  The weird thing is I intentionally created a loop by setting PIR motion sensor to both ON and OFF state.

371,Looking for feedback - Users subscribing but not understanding capabilities of product,"I built an application where users can click “record” then perform whatever actions in a browser like add data to CRM, send email, send message etc and then replace whatever value they typed in the recording with a dynamic value from google sheets. For example let’s say you want to send a bunch of users a message on Instagram and you have a list of usernames in a google sheet. You click record, go to Instagram, type in the username, type the message then click send. Then you edit this to use the value from google sheets instead of what you had actually typed.

Most of our users signed up to send automated instagram messages and have understood how that works pretty well but when wanting to automate actions on another site / in a different way it doesn't go too well.

Whatever you record can then be triggered by webhook, new row in google sheet, scheduled etc.

This is working great and we have a number of customers using it to send Instagram messages but they’re not seeing that the same idea can apply to LinkedIn, Facebook, openphone etc. without spending 10-30 minutes on a call they’re not understanding whatever action they record can be performed from a cloud service later with dynamic data so they don’t have to.

I’m a bit overly technical with explanations which is the fault for the majority of this but how would you better train users on the product without getting on 30 minute calls or building resource pages with videos that are just going unwatched

I understand a lot of these things can be done via api, with zapier etc but most users we have cannot do that and for some sites there is no api so there is no real alternative besides hiring a VA/being a developer to write a custom script/giving up your time

401,Automating Weq4u.. via Zapier or scripts or something similar?," 

We are based in the UK and use a horizon phone system.

One of our departments have to often queue for hours to talk to someone in another call centre they need, it wastes a lot of time, and they are tied up when clients need them, they dont want to put the queued call on hold to talk o a client in fear of missing when its answered.

Weq4u is an excellent free service which takes the sting out of this but with a couple of caveats.

It routes your call queue request based on caller Id so you can't have more than 1. Plus all of our agents have the outbound CID set to our main office number, so that's 1 for the whole company and the return path for that number is our reception. So it can't work from this CID

When you are at the front of the queue it gives you a quick missed call for you to redial from the relevant CID to connect, it doesn't just join in you when you answer the call.

My thoughts were that we could have separate VoIP lines (with any UK provider) for the agents just for managing weq4u, so our agent makes the call out with their unique CID, they join the outbound queue and presses 9\* to end the call, so weq4u does its magic and waits for an agent.  
Then weq4u rings back to that VoIP line (2 rings missed call) to tell it that the agent is ready on the outbound call. We have an automation somehow which immediately rejects the weq4u call based on its CID, then redials it (which you have to do), dials a hunt group (external inbound) number on our horizon system and transfers the call onto that hunt group (or conferences it if that's easier).

I could name the horizon hunt groups based on which agents queue will be calling so that everyone in that department can see that Agent X's outbound call queue is ready to talk, if they are available they will grab it, if they are away or on the phone someone else will grab it and do what's needed so it's not missed.

It's only a small department, currently only 4 but looking to expand to 8 agents, they all sit together and can easily see whos busy and whos not.

It should work in theory, but I've been trawling VoIP systems and automation systems and I can't find an obvious way to make this happen.

The system would need to have unlimited minutes, include the 0333 number in the minutes, and be able to present UK CID's

I would appreciate any pointers or ideas I'm a sys admin (and I do a bit of easy dev), I'm not up on all the VoIP solutions out there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/ywvzbc/automating_weq4u_via_zapier_or_scripts_or/,automat

The testing phase of the software development lifecycle is crucial. By handling tedious and repetitive duties like regression tests, automation testing frees up testers to focus on other high-quality activities like conducting exploratory tests and analyzing test findings, among other things. As a result, automation testing makes it possible for you to complete more tests faster.

Manual testing may become challenging as there are more features to test or more software faults to find. Automated testing can help with this.

To keep the software development process productive and effective, automation testing investment is crucial. You may run tests in any environment you require, as frequently as you like, and with automation. As a result, security and stability are improved, time and effort are saved, and maintenance costs are decreased.",https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/yqjg89/automated_testing_basics/,automat

411,Benefits Of Automation Testing,"Automation testing is one of the most popular methods for software testing. It’s an extremely efficient, cost-effective solution that can be adopted at any stage of your software development lifecycle – and it eradicates ambiguity on whether to use automation testing or stick to manual testing.

Automated testing has many benefits, such as: 

**Shift-left testing**\- It is a part of continuous testing that conveys that the testing phase should be incorporated into the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle), right from the requirement gathering phase to find bugs at an early stage. This can save money and time, by ensuring that bugs are found early by a tester.

**Easy regression testing-** Developers may need to perform a set of similar test cases over and over again, just to ensure that the bug has been removed. To make sure all testers have access to the latest changes, they have to spend time setting up the environment on their local machines and then run tests in parallel by creating new test plans and test cases every time. This leads to unnecessary wastage of time, money and efforts.

**Reduced business costs-** Automation testing offers significant benefits. It is advantageous for organizations because it reduces business expenses and enhances the quality of work. With automation testing, organizations are able to reduce additional expenses and maximize resource utilization.

**Improve the quality of manual tests-** With the help of test automation tools, you can perform manual testing very effectively. Test automation helps testers validate testing coverage in different environments and produces the required results at a much faster pace. These benefits of test automation have won customer favors in recent years.

**Better smoke testing-** Smoke tests are considered to be a best practice as they help avoid outages. These tests are used in the early phases of a project, and can catch major issues before tests begin running regularly. Automated smoke tests are an efficient way for teams to do this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/yid2dc/benefits_of_automation_testing/,automat

415,Importing Youtube History via Clicknium and Python,"Hello Everyone, I created a script to import history from one YouTube account to another. There is likely a better way than this, but since nothing existed I just wrote something quick and thought I'd share.

# The Method and Why

This will automatically iterate over your google takeout export and load each video in your previous watch history so that it can be registered in a new account. I use a 10 second wait between each load to ensure the browser has fully loaded the page and YouTube puts it into your watch history.

I created this because I was trying to move my YouTube history from one account to another, and could not find an option. If you want to fully transfer an account, there is a method for this, but I could not find anything for ONLY transferring watch history.

# Prerequisites

Visual Studio Code (you can use any tool to run the python script, this was my go to)

Vivaldi browser (you can probably modify the code below easy enough to work with others, but this is what I used)

Your watch history exported from google takeout

# Exporting History in Google Takeout

Go to [https://takeout.google.com](https://takeout.google.com) on the account you want to transfer history from

Click ""deselect all""

Scroll down to YouTube and YouTube Music section and check it

Click multiple formats and swap watch history from HTML to JSON then click ok

Click ""All YouTube data included""

Click deselect all

Check the history checkbox then hit ok

Click next step

Send via email to yourself. Depending on your length of watch history this will take a varying amount of time.

# Next Steps

If you do not have visual studio code, install it. Load a folder in it and create a python script (I called it [ImportHistory.py](https://ImportHistory.py))

Login to YouTube in the browser you use with the script below (currently written for vivaldi) with the account you want to import to.

Copy and paste the following into your created script

    from clicknium import clicknium as cc
    import json
    import time
    
    # install chrome extension and open a tab to automate
    cc.chromium('vivaldi').extension.install_or_update() 
    tab = cc.chromium('vivaldi').open(""www.google.com"") #Can be any url, just need to open a tab
    
    # Open the google takeout json for watch history
    with open('watch-history.json', encoding=""utf8"") as f:
        data = json.load(f)
      
      
        #Loop through each item in our history.
        for i in data['history']:
            #If there is a title url we can load it
            if 'titleUrl' in i:
                #Strip the https:// from the url in order to make goto work properly.
                url = str(i['titleUrl']).replace(""https://"", """")
    
                #Open the url and then wait for it to fully register youtube history
                tab.goto(url)
                time.sleep(10) #Arbitrary number, feel free to make shorter if it works
                                
      
    # Closing file and tab
        tab.close()
        f.close()

# After your Takeout is downloaded

Extract the zip and navigate to \\Takeout\\YouTube and YouTube Music\\history\\ where a watch-history.json file should live.

Copy the json file to the same folder as your python script you made.

Run the python file which will open a new browser window and tab. This tab will load all videos in sequential order. It is useful to do this in a single tab as you can right click the tab and mute to let this run in the background while you continue doing whatever else.

# How Long Will it Take?

This depends on how long your watch history is, but roughly 10 seconds per video in your history. This might take a really long time. You may try shortening the time.sleep(10) to a smaller value. I was able to successfully run as low as 5 seconds, but this started to cause some issues with not all results being put in my youtube history (likely due to load times).

# Modifying To Use Another Browser

The only lines you should need to change to make this work with another browser is the first two that install the chrome extension and open a tab, specifically

    cc.chromium('vivaldi').extension.install_or_update() 
    tab = cc.chromium('vivaldi').open(""www.google.com"") #Can be any url, just need to open a tab

Clicknium supports other browsers, and if you change this to open a tab on a different browser it should work fine, but you may need to modify it slightly as I have not tested in any other browser.

&#x200B;

421,Anyway to automate or macro this game modding process?,"So I'm part of a modding community for older NHL  games. One of the things we do is remove retired or young player portraits from the game and update with new images.  This is a time consuming process that takes 5-10 minutes per player. I appreciate we could probably get an app build but wanted some ideas about how we could automate speed up the process.  Its time consuming because we need to decrypted extract files make changes in Photoshop then rebuild. I have copied the instructions below but note its missing images as its a PDF. 

&#x200B;

Step 1: Find portrait ID  
Ex: McDavid, Portrait ID 9857  
Step 2: BIG File Extractor  
Open BigF  
Step 3: Find portrait  
Note, there are two locations. USRDIR\\fe\\ion\\artassets\\playerheads and  
USRDIR\\fe\\ion\\artassets\\playerheadssmall  
Both of these will need to be updated. One is for menu, one is for in-game.  
There are 3 folders within to split up the portraits, and one for blank silhouettes  
In this case, McDavid is in p8001\_12000, as we are looking for p9857.  
After selecting it, this should be your screen:  
These files all have their own use, and the names are all different depending on the portrait.  
Extract all to a new folder, I name it the portrait ID.  
We are looking for the Refpack compression that is not file 0. It is always the file with the biggest file  
size. In this case, it is file 3512.  
Step 4: QuickBMS decompression  
Open up QuickBMS and use the script refpack.bms  
Select the file name we found  
Save it in the same folder.  
Step 5: Photoshop  
Now there is a .dds file to edit. Open it up in photoshop.  
This is what we get  
Looks just like what is in the game with one difference – the black background. This is solved by  
using an alpha layer so we get what appears in the game:  
We’ll keep this in mind for later. For now, lets replace it with an updated portrait. Make sure the  
bottom of the picture cuts off where it did in the original.  
Now, lets get back to the alpha layer.  
In the bottom right corner in Photoshop, where you can add/change layers, there is a “channels”  
menu. Select it  
There are 5 layers. RGB, Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. Select the alpha layer.  
Lets make it completley black. I use Alt+Backspace as a shortcut to fill the image black.  
Now, go back to layers, then hold Ctrl+Left click on the thumbnail for the portrait to select it  
Go back to Channels and fill that selected part in with white. I use Ctrl+Backspace to fill it in.  
Notice now if you turn on the visibility for RGB (and keep Alpha visible) there is a red tint. This will  
not show up in the game, but the rest of the image will.  
Save the .dds, you can overwrite the old one if you want, or save it as a new file. But make sure you  
use these settings:  
Step 6: QuickBMS Compression  
Open QuickBMS with the refpack\_compress.bms script. Select the .dds file you just saved  
Save that in the same folder.  
Now, you notice the folder contains a new file.  
Delete the original file, in this case 3512. Then, rename the compressed dds file to be that name,  
with no extension. You can also delete the unpacked dds file. Your folder should look like this:  
Step 7: Rebuild .big  
Back in the BIG File Extractor, select Rebuild BIG. Select the folder that you were working in.  
Save the file in the folder that held the original .big file. Sometimes this program crashed when  
rebuilding, I have found that to reduce that crash you rename the file so it saves as a new file rather  
than overwrite the original one. There is still a chance the rebuild can crash. If it does, simply try it  
again with a new name.  
Once it is done, you should see this  
If your new file has a file size of 0, there was an error in rebuilding the .big file. Try to do it again.  
If it has worked, simply delete the original file and rename your file to be the same as the original.  
Done! Check it out in-game!  
Remember that this was the first of two files to replace. The other one is in playerheadssmall. It is  
what is used in the actual game, not in the menus. You have to go through these same steps to  
replace that one, as the file size is different.",https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/xsoo9l/anyway_to_automate_or_macro_this_game_modding/,automat

425,Automate Progress Reports for Teacher?,"Greetings All. My wife is a teacher, and her school requires teachers to do weekly progress reports for their students. Last night I was helping her set up this year's forms (63 total), which involved inputting the student's name, the appropriate teacher's name, and the date. Unfortunately, this is a largely manual process, requiring her to manually tally the number of missing assignments and transpose the details for each into its appropriate box on the form on a weekly basis (this eats up between 2 and 3 hours, since she has to switch back and forth between pages). She commented that she wished this sort of project could be automated, and it got me thinking about options. Unfortunately, her school is cheap as hell and will not invest in any gradebook applications (they rely solely on G-Suite, using a shared Google Sheets workbook for grade tracking (I know, lol)). 

What I would like to do is come up with a way to automatically fill in the student's details to the form (right now it is a Google Doc with crazy formatting, would love to move it to Word or PDF it but I need to maintain compatibility with G-Suite), date the form, and then tally the number of assignments missing for each class and load it into the  appropriate box on the form. Then I would need to automatically save the output so it is ready to print, while maintaining an archive of the file.

I used to work for a company that used a program that ran VBS scripts to generate the day's reports in a variety of formats (some Word, some Excel, a couple of PDFs). Ideally I would love to do something similar. However, I am learning as I go. So, I am curious what everyone would recommend for achieving this goal (e.g. do I need a program, do I just need scripts, what language, etc.). My hope is to give her an option that scrapes the master gradebook on command and carries the data to another spreadsheet (in case any students are added later we won't have to tweak the program), then carries over the student's data to the appropriate fields, then looks at the line of grades and reports on number of missing assignments (they score 0-4, with 0 being missing and anything 1 or above being turned in, so this should be a simple item to report on). The output would then export as either an editable document, a PDF, or both. If anyone has any external sites that they would recommend I research, please post the links!

The problem is, when we open tested this for 3 months, our company email got marked as spam.

Is there any way to prevent this? I have seen so many people sending newsletter and a similar notification email without being marked as spam so I know it is possible.

(sorry for my bad english, not my mother language).

I'm looking for a way to automate the following process to be done two times per day every monday to friday:

1. Open specific url in chrome
2. Log in with user and password
3. Navigate with several clicks to a ""export"" button that opens the window ""select where to download this file"" (this is not a link to the file, is a button).
4. Select a specific Google Drive folder to download the file.

I only know how a bit of coding in Google Apps Script,  I have tried Axiom, Chromium and Zapier, but I can not find a way to make it select the destination folder and download the file.

I am using a PC, windows, chrome, google drive.

Is there a tool with low code that I can set to do this? I am a one man company and I would prefer not having to pay an expensive license like UiPath or Automation Anywhere.

Also, is there a way to do this fully online so the task gets done even if I don't have my PC turned on?

438,Clicknium Automation Sample Solution - Data Migration,"Many enterprises need data migration solution. For example, if IT system is upgraded,there is need to migrate data from legacy system to upgraded system. This is a sample for employee data migration solution with[Clicknium](https://www.clicknium.com/) desktop&web automation. Here is the details: migrate employee data from a legacy thick client application into new HR system. The manual steps are as the follows:

* query data from legacy client app based on employee id.
* query more meta data of employee through internal REST API.
* fill the data of employee to the new HR system(web portal).

# Run this sample

* follow [clicknium getting started](https://www.clicknium.com/documents/quickstart) to set up develop environment.
* clone this sample repo
* download and unzip [legacy thick client app](https://github.com/AutomationAnywhere/Employee-Data-Migration/raw/master/EmployeeList.zip) to local repo folder.
* clone [sample repo](https://github.com/clicknium/clicknium-samples).

&#8203;

    git clone https://github.com/clicknium/clicknium-samples.git 

* open the folder 'EmployeeDataMigration' in Visual Studio Code
* through pipinstall the dependent packages

requestsis used to query data through internal REST api.

    pip install requests 

* open app.pyin Visual Studio Code .
* press F5to debug the sample or CTRL+F5to run the sample. You will see the result as below:

https://preview.redd.it/4kkbpsyo1of91.png?width=522&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6402101b350919763c67b1d00f041b6e135705a9

# The Purpose of the Sample

* open the legacy client application with subprocess module, and it will be used to query data later.

&#8203;

    current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) employeeList_exe = os.path.join(current_dir, ""EmployeeList.exe"") process = subprocess.Popen(employeeList_exe) 

* open the browser with Clicknium python module and open new HR system. In this sample microsoft edge browser will be used.

&#8203;

    tab = cc.edge.open(""https://developer.automationanywhere.com/challenges/automationanywherelabs-employeedatamigration.html"") 

When the browser is opened, it will return to the edge tab/page.

* get the employee id in new HR system with Clicknium web automaton

&#8203;

    employee_id = tab.find_element(locator.employeedatamigration.developer.text_employeeid).get_text() 

* based on the captured employee\_id above, find the employee information on legacy client application with Clicknium desktop automation.

&#8203;

    cc.ui(locator.employeedatamigration.employee.edit_txtempid).set_text(employee_id, by='set-text')
    cc.ui(locator.employeedatamigration.employee.button_btnsearch).click(by='control-invocation')
    item[""first_name""] = cc.ui(locator.employeedatamigration.employee.edit_txtfirstname).get_text()
    item[""last_name""] = cc.ui(locator.employeedatamigration.employee.edit_txtlastname).get_text()
    item[""email_id""] = cc.ui(locator.employeedatamigration.employee.edit_txtemailid).get_text()
    item[""city""] = cc.ui(locator.employeedatamigration.employee.edit_txtcity).get_text()
    ... ...

automatically set text for employee\_id and click search button to capture all information such as first\_name, last\_name etc of this employee In desktop application operation,Clicknium uses mouse&keyboard simulation by default . In this legacy application, the input and button control support control invocation, so we can use it by pass parameter byin click and set\_text api.

* through requestsmodule, send http request to get the extra information(phone number, start date ) of the employee.

&#8203;

    response = requests.get(api_url + employee_id)
    print(datetime.datetime.now().strftime(""%H:%M:%S"") + "" get response"")
    obj = json.loads(response.content.decode('UTF-8'))
    item[""phoneNumber""] = obj[""phoneNumber""]
    item[""startDate""] = obj[""startDate""]

* fill the data into new HR system through clicknium web automation.

&#8203;

    tab.find_element(locator.employeedatamigration.developer.text_firstname).set_text(item[""first_name""])
    tab.find_element(locator.employeedatamigration.developer.text_lastname).set_text(item[""last_name""])
    tab.find_element(locator.employeedatamigration.developer.text_phone).set_text(item[""phoneNumber""])
    tab.find_element(locator.employeedatamigration.developer.text_email).set_text(item[""email_id""])
    ... ...
    tab.find_element(locator.employeedatamigration.developer.button_submitbutton).click()

In code above, you can see:

* The locator is separated from code , so the locator store can be managed independently. If the new HR system is upgradeD, the locator will changed and the locator store will be updated as well.
* As Clicknium provides unified API for both desktop and web automation, you can write automation code in the same way for browser and windows application.

# Locator

The [Locator](https://www.clicknium.com/documents/concepts/locator) is the identifier of UI element , which can be recorded or edited with [clicknium vs code extension ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ClickCorp.clicknium).

In this sample, you can open the locator in Visual Studio Code , for example:

https://preview.redd.it/jhpfwk7v1of91.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8a4675d5acb9b5b35838548a8be0ccb8f62476e1

# Compare with Selenium & Playwright

* The web driver needs to be downloaded in Selenium matching exactly the browser . In this example, the Edge browser version is 103.0.1264.62, so there is a need to download the same version MS Edge web driver first.
* Selenium and playwright can only support web automation. So when it comes to employee data migration solution, you can operate on the legacy client app by using another library such as pywinauto.

9. Close opened browser tab.  
   ```python  
   browser_tab.close()# close the opened browser tab.
   ``` 
# Tips 
- Pass variable to the locator  
In this sample channel name is passed to the `matched_result_span` locator as following
  - Define variable in locator  
   ![](imgs/pass_variable.png)  
  -  Pass variable in code
      ```python
      matched_result_span=clicknium.wait_appear(locator.websites.app_slack.matched_result_span,{""channel_name"": channel_name})
      ```
- Use wildcard in locator  
In this sample `channel_sort_btn` locator's sInfo is updated end with *

441,Sample to demostrate clicknium web automation solution - customer onboarding," 

This is a sample of customer onboarding solution through [clicknium](https://www.clicknium.com/) web automation .

For one enterprise, customer onboarding has a significant impact on whether a customer keeps using your product or not, you may define the customer onboarding process in your comany internally, for example, need add new customer information into CRM(customer relationship management) system. If you can automatically to do customer onboarding process, it should improve the efficiency significantly. Here we demo one custoemr onboarding automation solution:

* load the missing customer's information from CSV file .
* open CRM system.
* iterate the records in CVS file , fill into CRM form and register each customer.

# Run this sample

* follow [clicknium getting started](https://www.clicknium.com/) to set up develop environment.
* clone [sample repo](https://github.com/clicknium/clicknium-samples).

&#8203;

    git clone https://github.com/clicknium/clicknium-samples 

* open the folder 'CustomerOnboarding' in Visual Studio code
* through pip  
 install the dependenct packages

requests  
 is used to download the CSV file and pandas  
 is used to read CSV file .

    pip install requests pip install pandas 

* open app.py  
 in Visual Studio Code .
* press F5  
 to debug the sample or press CTRL+F5  
 to run sample.

You will see the result:

# What the sample do

* open the testing CRM web portal.
* get the url of CSV to be download.
* download the CSV file .

&#8203;

    tab = cc.edge.open(""https://developer.automationanywhere.com/challenges/automationanywherelabs-customeronboarding.html"")
    url = tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.a_downloadcsv).get_property(""href"")
    excelFile = requests.get(url)
    temp_file = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'missing.csv')
    open(temp_file, 'wb').write(excelFile.content)
    data = pd.read_csv(temp_file)

* iterate the records and fill the data into CRM system and register the customer.

&#8203;

    for idx, item in data.iterrows():
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.text_customername).set_text(item[0])
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.text_customerid).set_text(item[1])
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.text_primarycontact).set_text(item[2])
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.text_street).set_text(item[3])
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.text_city).set_text(item[4])
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.select_state).select_item(item[5])
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.text_zip).set_text(""%05d"" % item[6])
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.email_email).set_text(item[7])
    if item[8] == ""YES"":
        tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.radio_activediscountyes).set_checkbox()
    else:
        tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.radio_activediscountno).set_checkbox()
            
    if item[9] == ""YES"":
        nda = 'check'
    else:
        nda = 'uncheck'
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.checkbox_nda).set_checkbox(check_type=nda)
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.button_submit_button).click()

From above code , you can see:

* Locator is separate from code , so locator store can be managed independently, if the CRM system is upgrade, locator is changed, just need update the locator store.
* Easy to select option from dropdown list: tab.find\_element(<locator>).select\_item(<option>)
* Easy to check radio button/checkbox: tab.find\_element(<locator>).set\_checkbox()

# Locator

[Locator](https://www.clickcorp.com/documents#automation/locator) is the identifier of UI element, through [clicknium vs code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ClickCorp.clicknium) can record/edit the locator.

# Compare with Selenium

* Selenium need download the webdriver which version should exactly match the browser , in this example, my Edge browser version is 103.0.1264.62  
, so I need download the same version msedge web driver first.
* Selenium does not support check operation for radion button, need use click instead.

&#8203;

    driver.find_element('id', 'activeDiscountYes').click() 

* To select option from dropdown list, need import additional class to wrapper.

&#8203;

    from selenium.webdriver.support.select import Select
    Select(driver.find_element('id', 'state')).select_by_value(item[5])

* Compare the running time In this sample, need fill 7 records, each record need submit 10 fields. From the log, we can see clicknium is more faster than selenium.

442,Clicknium Automation Sample Solution - Finance Quarter Close,"For many enterprises, at the end of each fiscal quarter, the finance team spends much time making all of the financial obligations fulfilled. This is a sample of financial quarter close solution with [clicknium](https://www.clicknium.com/) automation. It can review transactions automatically. Here is the details: go through transactions in local financial system to find the matching transaction in the Bank system. If the match is found, change the `Transaction Status` to `Verified` in local financial system.

The manual steps are as follows:

* login to local financial system.
* Query the transactions in this quarter.
* login to the bank system.
* For each transaction:
   * based on `Payment Account`, navigate to corresponding page.
   * search 'Payment Amount'.
   * If the matched one is found, go back to local financial system, set the `Transaction Status` to Verified.
* After all transactions are reviewed, click `Submit` button in local financial system.

445,Automating a way to fill out a form in a desktop app,"The majority of my job is reading through technical reports of product failures, and filling out an assessment form (open text, dropdowns, radio buttons, etc) based on the information. Essentially I am making an assessment of the report. The open text portions of the forms are mostly things I can copy and paste from previous templates, with some slight modifications needed here and there. However the radio buttons and drop downs change depending on the type of report I’m reviewing. 

An example would be:
I have a report for test results which specify that the test failed due to user error. I would then use that report to complete the assessment form and check all the right boxes and enter the correct text needed to summary the issue.  

All of these reports and forms are housed in a proprietary desktop app on MacOS. 

I would like to automate this process to increase efficiency because my team process hundreds of these every week. 

Big disclaimer: I am not a programmer, but I am an engineer. 

Can anyone recommend an automated solution where I can basically just select the type of report I received and it somehow populates the entire form for me based on my selection? 
I assume it would need some type of script where I can pre-populate the form entries, but I have no clue how to do this. 

Using my previous example, perhaps the script could ask me what type of report I received, then I could select “testing-user error” and it would populate everything I need into the assessment form.

I've created links that look like, for example:

itms://apps.apple.com/us/app/mobilefuge/id503610940?uo=4

I put the links into an html file I can open in a browser, and when I click on a link, the app's page opens in iTunes. Then I click a button in iTunes that says ""Get"", and it downloads to my PC. Rinse and repeat. Occasionally iTunes prompts me to re-enter my password, which I paste in and click OK.

This works, but it's incredibly tedious. Does anyone have suggestions for how I could automate this process? If it was all in a browser I could probably figure it out, but I've never done anything with automating a random program.

Before we can answer the question why the Helpmate project has failed we have to answer, if this was the case. It seems, that there a different opinions available if a hospital robot makes sense or not. The idea from the manufacturing company was, that a robot can do repetitive tasks much faster and at lower costs and this makes a robot a good choice to automate something. The counter argument is, that robots won't improve the productivity because they are too complicated to use.

i want to automate to check if there is any change on website of my university.

I have tries many many MANY ways but nothing works so i am writing this here after many failed attempts.

I am trying to automate checking if there are any new notifications on my university website. I need to go to It's page ([https://university.com/Index.jsp?)](https://university.com/Index.jsp?)) and to login with my credentials and then i am greeted with my profile on their webisode ([https://university.com/StudentIndex.jsp?)](https://university.com/StudentIndex.jsp?)) where i can see if there are any new notifications. I have made selenium script that basically goes to that website, takes screenshot and compare it to an image i have took when there are no new notifications. If they are not the same, there are notifications and via versa. Easy! But when i want to put that script on my Raspberry Pi it doesn't work. I don't have X on there so selenium doesn't like it. I have tried with all sorts of modules (PyVirtualDisplay,...) but everything just make my RPI(3B) freeze and nothing. Ok so i have gone in another direction. I looked at wget and curl. But problem is UNI website has bad ssl. Ok --no-check-certification does the work, but still it wouldn't get pass login page. Ok then i have tried with cookies which i get when i log in, but wget says [https://university.com/Index.jsp](https://university.com/Index.jsp)? does not exist but [https://university.com](https://university.com) does, but if you go there there is no login. WTF. Ok then i have tried HTTrack but i am confused on how to add cookies to login ( i am on Linux Arch so i can use only cli version).

Ok that doesn't work as well, ok go look into another direction. I have tried to look for some website that does that, and there are some.Nice! But they are all paid, and if not paid they don't work. I don't know why, probably cause it is dynamic website and not static.

467,Automation and political systems discussion,"In non complicated automated systems there’s two types and one could be seen as old and one as new or one as proprietary and one versatile but the reality is one type is based on things that are concrete in nature and where any change is minor and always an improvement where the other is based on a world where any business could go under at any moment and keeping with trends is more important than keeping up with needs, a world where recovering investment is more important than efficiency of operation or making things that last both in durability and requirement/need/desire to own. So my discussion prompt is what do you think about the move to using robotic arms and programming for everything instead of more mechanical versions that hardly require electricity and have all safeguards physical, where one motor can often do everything versus needing a software programmer? And my second part of my prompt is what are your options on politics and economics discouraging or encouraging automation use, should there be an incentive or even requirement? Should there be a classification system to identify automation that suits a need versus ones that serve a profit instead? Should a tighter standardization of motors and wear components be implemented as to allow automation of repairs also?

&#x200B;

I’m new to automated testing with Selenium and have some questions regarding the following that I want to accomplish.

\-	I want to define a generic Xpath within the Action (Helper location), that I can reuse for several fields on the web-application form page.

\-	Basically I want to find the class element that I have written down in Step 2 and fill the k-textbox with a value by using the generic Xpath from Step 1.

&#x200B;

The below example is not working for me and I guess I have messed it up, would be nice If someone could provide me with an example. Thanks!

&#x200B;

Step1:

My current generic Xpath within the Action (Helper location), that I want use for several fields on the webpage form.

&#x200B;

Example what I got.

&#x200B;

public void SelectAndTypeEditFieldByLabelGeneric(string label, string searchtext)

{

TypeByXpath(""//\*\[contains(@class,'form-col') or contains(@class, 'form-input')\]//\*\[text()='"" + label + ""'\]/parent::div//input"", searchtext);

}

&#x200B;

Step 2:

From my steps location I fil in the input values with the reference toward the generic Xpath from step 1.

&#x200B;

Example what I got.

&#x200B;

\[When(@""I Fill In The Account Details"")\]

public void WhenIFillInTheAccountDetails(string label, string searchtext)

{

Action.SelectAndTypeEditFieldByLabelGeneric(""Bedrijfsnaam"", ""Test Company"");

Action.SelectAndTypeEditFieldByLabelGeneric(""Straat"", ""Test Street"");

Action.SelectAndTypeEditFieldByLabelGeneric(""Huisnummer"", ""999"");

    }  

Furthermore the When condition here has a relation with the SpecFlowFeature for the scenario.

&#x200B;

Scenario: Add A New Account

    When I Fill In The Account Detail

EDIT: I found the issue and solved the problem.

I changed: 

public void SelectAndTypeEditFieldByLabelGeneric(string label, string searchtext) With -> 'public void WhenIFillInTheAccountDetailsTest() .

However, after making many consecutive searches (the number varies but around 5+), the site stops loading searches again for 10-20 minutes.

I have tried using the undetected\_chromedriver extension and altered my input to appear more human-like by entering phrases character by character, adding random delays between every action, and hovering over elements before clicking.

509,Selenium Timeout - Expected Condition returning False,"I'm coding a bot in Python that plays tic-tac-toe. The game is a Web  app written in React.js and is equipped with an AI of its own that  utilizes minimax. The user (which the Python bot simulates) is always X,  the AI is always O, and the user always moves first. The Python bot  plays by randomly selecting unmarked squares (this is only to  demonstrate automated UI testing).

**I was getting stuck inside a recursive function.**

    for i in clickedSquares:             
         if not winner:                 
              self.checkForWinner(load_browser, winner)

         else:                 
              clickedSquares.append(random_square)

To fix this issue I added the **if not winner** condition  where ""winner"" is a string. This does terminate the loop; however, I'm  getting an error as soon as the checkForWinner() function is called  because winnerOh is always false. 

    winnerOh = WebDriverWait(load_browser, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH, Tags.resultOh)))         
    
    winnerEx = WebDriverWait(load_browser, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH, Tags.resultEx)))         
    
    tiedGame = WebDriverWait(load_browser, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH, Tags.resultTie)))

 I'm looking for an element on the UI that declares the winner: X or O or  tie, which will only appear if the game is over.  So  WebDriverWait().until() is timing out waiting for that element to  appear, but it hasn't yet, because it's only the second move in the  game. 

I'm not sure how to fix this issue. If I remove the call to  checkForWinner() the bot will get stuck in the recursive call to  test\_playTTT(). The browser will not close after the game is over, and  the test will not end successfully.

**Is there another way to check the UI for the element I'm looking for that won't immediately return a False condition?  Is there a  better way for me to write this for loop?**

521,What is selenium automation testing?,"Automation testing is the process of executing a set of predefined tests over and over again in a rapid and repeatable way, ensuring that they are always up-to-date. Automation testing dramatically reduces the need for manual testing, allowing you to focus on more important work. It also makes executing tests faster and allowed for more frequent testing.

Selenium is an open source test automation framework written in Java. It supports various browsers and provides support for various testing frameworks such as JUnit, TestNG. Selenium uses different software called drivers to control the browser.

Some of the reasons behind its popularity are as follows:

1) Tests can be written in various programming languages.

2) Tests can be run in different operating systems.

3) It supports any browser that is available.

4) It can integrate with other software frameworks like TestNG and JUnit for project management and reporting purposes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/xj51f3/what_is_selenium_automation_testing/,automat

 Selenium is free and an open source tool that provides an API for web developers to provide a language-independent method for writing tests. The underlying framework allows users to write test scripts in various programming languages like Java, Ruby or any other language. You can even use JSON, XML or any other data formats with Selenium without having to learn complex programming languages.

It tests your web applications by performing actions such as clicking buttons and verifying text displays in order to generate an automated functional test.

536,Is VS Code a good IDE/text editor to create a selenium framework in?,"To give you all some context of why i am asking this:

I'm currently trying to create the same POM-based selenium webdriver framework for multiple programming languages (Java, C#, Python, and JavaScript). I am doing this so that when it comes to interviews based around Selenium, i will well-prepped and language agnostic since i've already got a Selenium template good to go for whatever language that company uses. I figured that JS, Java, C#, & Python were the most commonly-used languages when it comes to Selenium.

Anyhow... I've noticed so far that VS code is a pain in the ass with Selenium in Java. I installed the Extension Pack for Java, and that seemed to have given me everything i need to run Java Code. I then was able to get selenium to run with the main method. And then soon after a bit of tinkering with TestNG, i was able to get my example test to run from my test method within my testNG test class.

&#x200B;

Heres the problem. When i run my TestNG tests from the test section of VS code (with the java extenion pack installed), the only meaningful failure output i see is that the test method failed. But it doesn't show me which specific assertion in my test method failed. This leads me to think that maybe VS Code isn't the best IDE/editor to run selenium code for Java? What do you all think? 

&#x200B;

I would PREFER to use VS code because that's the same IDE/text Editor that I use with [Cypress.io](https://Cypress.io) automation. But it seems like TestNG is either NOT meant to be run with VS Code at all or i need to use a completely different assertion library or something with VS Code to have an easier ""automation experience"". 

Does anyone have any suggestions on 1) Which IDE/text editor i should be using with Java Selenium. and 2) Any unit test libraries or extensions i could use that i'm not using here?

&#x200B;

NOTE: I'm fully aware of Eclipse and jUnit, but i feel like that IDE is super old and crappy and JUnit doesn't have the same capabilities as TestNG.  Anyhow thanks for the feedback in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/wxxehn/is_vs_code_a_good_idetext_editor_to_create_a/,automat

546,Scraping tumblr,"Hi everyone!  
I come to you in a time of need, since I have no idea how scraping or programming works, so I was hoping there's an easier way that I haven't found yet.  
Here's the deal: I need a way to find every post on tumblr that has a specific note. For example, if I were to reblog or like a post, my username would show up underneath and it'd say ""'username' liked this.""   
As you can imagine, there are millions of posts and going through all of their notes manually is impossible, so I figured that:  
a. Either I download the whole thing and somehow search locally on my pc, though it'd probably take a lot;  
b. Find a software that crawls the site and then apply a filter to that username to find the posts they've reacted to.  
Is this doable? Is there anyway someone could do this?  
I'm sorry if I don't make much sense, I have no experience with python and other stuff that is usually used in this sort of things. Thank you so much!",https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/zxz7a7/scraping_tumblr/,filter
548,"Ebay Scraping, filter out international results, select parents that do not have specific descendants","Hello all! I have some code that I put together to scrape ebay sold prices using BeautifulSoup and so far it is working pretty good. The only issue I currently have is that it also pulls prices for 2 categories that ebay adds to the search results page (International Sellers, and results matching fewer words)

I am struggling to filter these out. Its like I need to identify if the listing (the parent) contains a specific descendant and then filter out that parent. I hope that is clear, here is a sample:

[https://www.ebay.com/sch/57988/i.html?\_from=R40&\_nkw=Fjallraven%20nuuk%20parka&LH\_Complete=1&LH\_Sold=1&\_udlo=50&\_udhi=600&LH\_PrefLoc=1](https://www.ebay.com/sch/57988/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=Fjallraven%20nuuk%20parka&LH_Complete=1&LH_Sold=1&_udlo=50&_udhi=600&LH_PrefLoc=1)

The picture below is an example of an item that I would like to filter out. It has a Span Class for location. This class only exists if the item is from an international seller.

550,I made a fast proxy fetcher package in python,"I got sick if getting blocked by websites while web scrapping, so I made a python package & CLI that finds free tested proxies for you REALLY FAST.

That package named Ballyregan, and it's key features are:
• Proxy fetching - get valid proxies fast. You can also filter while fetching by protocol or anonymity.
• Proxy validation - you can use the ProxyValidator by itself to validate proxies.
• Proxy filtering - you can filter your own list of proxies by anonymity and protocol.

Check it out:

This is my first package and I will really appreciate your opinion on it.

The ideal case is that they would be further categorised by the kind of action to be taken. Then with an AI language model, a draft is there to send - e.g. when someone asks for a call, there are two drafts there: no thanks, and a yes with a link to my calendar.

This probably isn't the cleanest code anyone has seen but, currently I am looking for some help or even ideas.   This code I've made is a project for fun, reason why I made this is I like to travel and yes I get there are other things like Hopper and FlightTracker but wanted to try some things on my own.

&#x200B;

**Here is what the code does:** It goes to the [AA.com](https://AA.com) site > Searches for the airport I depart from and want to arrive > Enters in the travel dates > Searches for them > AA (Tells me the dates are incorrect) I tell it to hit the submit button again  and it works > Then it takes a screen shot of the  depart flight of the first half of the page, saves it in my downloads then  clicks on the first box because it is the cheapest > Then Takes a screenshot of a return flight and saves it to my download.

(I haven't put this code on reddit but if anyone wants it I can easily give it to them.)  The next steps are I have another script run a couple minutes after > Picks up the files I saved to my downloads > Attaches it to an email and then the email sends it to me)

&#x200B;

**What i'm trying to get help with is i'm trying to get rid of the old way screenshots and putting this info into an excel document, or even put text into an email with Flight number, Price, Date, Time... ETC but i've ran into a road block and i'm not even sure if this is possible. Would love some help if anyone has experience.**

565,"[C#] How to resolve ""Cannot access a disposed object"" error","Hey, folks. I've got an error that keeps coming up in a variety of tests, seemingly at random. I'm sure it's not random, but I can't identify the pattern (and subsequently the fix).

For context I have 29 tests running on windows VMs through Azure DevOps. I've got it set to 10 threads (browsers) but I can change that.

The error comes from somewhere I wouldn't expect it. Basically, I'm waiting for the invisibility of an element. Something like:

>return wait.Until(ExpectedConditions.InvisibilityOfElementLocated(By.XPath(locator)));

or

>element.Click();

This isn't a complicated line of code, and generally speaking if it fails I would expect to get an exception. But ""Cannot access a disposed object"" doesn't really tell me what the problem is or how to resolve it.

&#x200B;

It's important to note that these tests don't fail when I run them on my machine against a browser (i.e. not in a VM). I'm not sure if it has something to do with timing, with threading.

576,Why is the third click action here timing out?,"I'm trying to navigate through this webpage so I can scrape data from the ""Matchups"" table. What I've written so far is able to click through the ""basic"" button and the ""matchups"" button, but the request to click the ""show numbers"" button always times out unless I give the full XPATH as the locator. I think that it could be that the condition ""element\_to\_be\_clickable"" is not met because an ad covers the button so it isn't visible, however I don't think that explains why it works when I supply the full XPATH.

I could, of course, just supply the full XPATH, although I've heard that this is not good practice and is less resilient to changes to the website.

EDIT:

I think I've figured out the issue. There are two elements on the site with ID ""showNumbers"" which is curious site design and I'm still not sure the best way to work around this.

It isn't looking great doing the same thing three times, which is why I tried to make a function, but I have encountered issues.

First issue is that I am unsure how to give the function a variable that it should then add the minutes to. activity_spent for example, it doesn't seem to add the time when I call the function giving it the variable time_read or time_programmed, even though these variables exist already, or even if they don't.

Second issue is that I now need multiple different elements from the same one for two or three activities, walking, running and hiking. Here I want more than simply time, now I need the distance and maybe heart rate as well. 

Third issue, and last one, is that the next step would be to summarize the time spent that day in some creative format, maybe there is a library that can summarize it into a banner, that I then can use for the twitter bot? I will have to look into it.

Then fixing all the explicit waits to something better of course.

	time_read += result.tm_min

	print(time_read)

```

So this is my current code. It finds the date, checks if it is today and adds the minutes to the variable time_read. 

Now I need some help in how I go about adding multiple elements, and if this can be done with some kind of for loop, where it loops between the dates and can then extract the time from the element?

Do I need to set them up one by one, since I need to provide which element a specific iteration needs to pull from? So maybe I should have 5 or 6 checks for example, instead of some kind of loop that goes through and does it? Then it will be a lot of manual work, which makes me question if there isn't a better way to deal with it.

I do not want to use CSV.


Some relevant HTML
```
<div class=""pull-left activity-date date-col"">
        <span class=""unit"">Sep 14</span>
        <span class=""label"">2022</span>
    </div>

<span class=""unit"" title=""3:32:00""><span class="""" data-placement=""top"" title=""3:32:00"">3:32:00</span></span>

<span class=""unit"" title=""1:00:00""><span class="""" data-placement=""top"" title=""1:00:00"">1:00:00</span></span>
<span class="""" data-placement=""top"" title=""1:00:00"">1:00:00</span>
```

Also a bit unsure what the best way is to locate elements? Is CSS.SELECTOR good or should I use XPATH preferably?

What kind of features would you like such a service to have?

Currently I offer 2 main functionalities:

* Scraping API. It returns data from a target URL using proxies either purely as HTML or scraping specific fields and returning them as JSON
* Crawling. In the user panel users can configure scraping profiles to be used for different web pages with an UI that allows you to interactively click on elements of the target page to be selected for scraping. Full website crawling is configurable by creating a crawling agent which consists of list of URL patterns which should either be followed and/or scraped using an extraction profile. All this can be run as a job resulting in a JSON or CSV file with rows populated from all scraped pages.

The bottom line is I want to understand what you would like to see in a free tier of such a service and I will try my best to meet it.

The idea is to just grab all the text from the website and tokenize the input, and convert it. To a vector via tf-idf, before feeding it into a binary classification model. Which has been pre-trained on labeled data beforehand. If the model outputs us a success we’ll add the data, else we’ll discard it. 

The reason why I used machine learning to differentiate  between the text that is important and the irrelevant ones, is because the text I need doesn’t follow a uniform structure, ie every website could have it laid out differently. So regex and basic heuristics is out of the question as far as I know.

The result are pretty disappointing, it’s true positive rate is high, but so is the false positive rate. Has anyone does anything similar, or have any guidance?

642,Review of ChatGPT/AI for LinkedIn for marketing,"Recently, I found a Chrome extension called Engage AI. I've been using the tool for the past week or two. I wanted to share my experience with it.

The Chrome extension essentially writes comments for you for LinkedIn posts. All you have to do is copy the link of a post and paste it into the extension. The app scrapes information from the post and comments, then it generates a related comment for you using AI.

The comments generated by the extension are accurate and have perfect spelling and grammar. They sound genuine, human, and high-effort, far better than generic comments such as ""Great post"" or ""Thanks for sharing.""

Unfortunately, the comments aren’t always accurate. Occasionally, the app will generate a comment that doesn’t make much sense with the post and I need to refresh it. It’s also a shame that it’s specific for LinkedIn and no other platforms, so you’re out of luck if you don’t use LI.

It's not for everyone, but for someone like me who uses LinkedIn to build relationships with leads for my employer, it's a great help. I feel like VAs could benefit a lot from this, and anyone else trying to stay in front of your target audience on LinkedIn.

Personally, I comment on prospects' posts on a weekly basis. It can take me hours to come up with, say, twenty insightful and well-thought-out comments. With this extension, those hours are reduced to just a few minutes. I've gotten positive feedback from the comments I've made with it so far.

Overall, the app is a great time-saver and saves me the effort of needing to write a comment that makes sense in a field I’m not always familiar with. I’m already on the paid plan, but there’s a free trial if you want to test it out.

673,General advice on setting up tests,"Hello! I am pretty new to testing and Selenium and I feel as though I'm *not getting it*. 

I'm currently building an e-commerce portfolio app with Django; right now I have my accounts app set up to register new users, log them in/out, and delete their accounts. Presumably I'd like to test all those features in a script: load my app, create a new user, log that new user in, log them out, delete the account.

I've encountered a countless number of technical difficulties even performing one of these tasks. I've found the official documentation to be contradictory and confusing (maybe it's just me); every tutorial I've found so far has used outdated syntax and only delves into the most uselessly superficial tasks (loading a URL and that's it).

So I'd like some advice on where to go to figure out what the process is for testing what I'm aiming to test. **What's the general strategy for setting up these tests**? Are there any up-to-date resources available that focus on more useful testing processes?

For a specific example of a problem I'm encountering: how does one handle loading a different page during the test? I have been able to register a new user; on clicking ""submit,"" it takes them to a login page. How do I wait for the new login page to load before continuing? Implicitly waiting doesn't seem to do anything, but `time.sleep()` does.

Even if someone has a link to a repo that includes some tests in Python (especially if it's Django!) would be wonderful to see. I learn by example pretty well. Thanks for any advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/109gvcx/general_advice_on_setting_up_tests/,specific

675,Custom profiles of chrome not running in multithreading,"Hi Everyone,

I have an issue ongoing, I am trying to run custom chrome profiles with selenium,

The issue is that a single profile runs fine but when I use ThreadPoolExecutor, and open like three chrome profiles in parallel, one out of them works fine but the rest two do not do anything, they are just like halted. The code is concerned  is as follow:

`def browserthread(link):`  
 `i=links.index(link)`  
 `chrome_options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()`  
 `chrome_options.add_argument(""user-data-dir=C:\\Users\\LENOVO\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data"")`

 `drivers.append(driver)`

`with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=threadnum) as pool:`  
 `response_list = list(pool.map(browserthread,links))`  
`drivers.clear()`

If multiple threads are run without profile specification, than all the chrome instances work fine, but when three profiles are opened in separate threads, only one instance works fine meanwhile other two remain halted.

Long term, I want to run a browser test, take a screenshot if there is a failure, and also send an email if any part of the test fails.  


I'm trying to understand if something exists in the Selenium library that would do this, or if this needs to be part of the Python script, if that makes sense?

Do I need to run each section of the test as a function of some sort, that will only continue if it passes?

731,Problems with new Instagram layout: Unable to locate element,"I need a nudge in the right direction: Instagram has changed the interface. Since then, my testing script for posts no longer works. The until recently this section was enough to initiate a new post:

driver.find\_element\_by\_xpath('//div\[@class=""\_abm0""\]/\*\[name()=""svg""\]\[@aria-label=""New post""\]').click()

The new interface has been changed only slightly and the element in question looks like this:

<svg aria-label=""New post"" class=""\_ab6-"" color=""#262626"" fill=""#262626"" height=""24"" role=""img"" ... </svg>

Which led me to the following adjustment:

driver.find\_element\_by\_xpath('//div\[@class=""\_ab6-""\]/\*\[name()=""svg""\]\[@aria-label=""New post""\]').click()

But it will not work like this anyway. The error message is:

selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: no such element:: {""method"":""xpath"",""selector"":""//div\[@class=""\_ab6-""\]/\*\[name()=""svg""\]\[@aria-label=""New post""\]""}  (Session info: chrome=106.0.5249.121)

1076,*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

1084,Problem with selecting a checkbox next to target text (text has no HTML tags),"Good evening everyone!

I can't solve a problem with iMacros and it is really bugging me, so I would really appreciate if someone could help me. I hope I've opened the topic on the correct board; otherwise, please forgive me, for this is my first post.
I spent hours and hours going through the wiki and this forum, but I cannot reach my goal of selecting checkboxes with the target text next to them on a specific website. So I'm starting to wonder if it's the problem of the HTML code, or if I'm doing something entirely wrong. I will describe the details below.

1. Config Info: 

iMacros for Firefox plugin 8.9.7, free (VERSION BUILD=8970419); browser: Pale Moon 28.9.3; OS: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit English

2. Target site code: 

The text content were replaced with general English terms because they were originally in Hungarian. (Also, ""etc etc"" was written by me in the STYLE section because it was a rather long style section with no real impact on my issue/macro itself.)  
Code: Select all<DIV id=""cuccLayer"" STYLE=""position:absolute; font-weight:bold; (etc etc...); "">
		 <center>Title1</center>
		 <hr>

<input type=""checkbox"" onClick=""cuccArray[0]=1-cuccArray[0];""> 410 pcs. ITEM1<br><input type=""checkbox"" onClick=""cuccArray[1]=1-cuccArray[1];""> 27 pcs. ITEM2<br><input type=""checkbox"" onClick=""cuccArray[2]=1-cuccArray[2];""> 9 pcs. ITEM3<br><input type=""checkbox"" onClick=""cuccArray[3]=1-cuccArray[3];""> 1 pc. ITEM4<br><input type=""checkbox"" onClick=""cuccArray[4]=1-cuccArray[4];""> 89 pcs. ITEM5<br><input type=""checkbox"" onClick=""cuccArray[5]=1-cuccArray[5];""> 23 pcs. ITEM6<br>
		 <hr>
		 <center>
		 <input type=""image"" src="".../SUBMIT.gif"" title=""SUBMIT"" onClick=""document.urlap.par1.value=cuccArrayToString(); document.urlap.Submit.value='svSelejtezes'; document.urlap.submit();"">
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		 <input type=""image"" src="".../sample2.gif"" width=""35"" height=""35"" title=""Title2"" onClick=""cuccHide(); return false;"">
		 </center>
</DIV>

3. Problem: 

I'm trying to write a macro that will look for specific text(s) on a site and then select the checkbox on the left side of it. For example, let's say I want to select the checkboxes to the left of the texts ""pcs.<SP>ITEM3"", ""pcs.<SP>ITEM4"" and ""pcs.<SP>ITEM5"". 

However, the checkboxes and the text are in a shared DIV container called ""cuccLayer"" and the texts don't have their own HTML tags and because of that, I fail to use relative positioning, even though I went over a lot of chivracq's posts dealing with the topic. I simply cannot come up with a solution, because all the macros I wrote (even after tweaking with POS=R1,R-1, etc) seem to handle all the text as a whole (verified by extraction in test mode) and I cannot position the checkboxes. My last idea before giving up and posting here was using relative positioning with the <br>tag, with no success (maybe TAG cannot be used with empty tags lacking an end tag, or simply <br> is not recognized?) 

The position/order of the checkboxes + texts are not static but PHP/JS-related, so the checkbox must be selected based on the current text following it (for more info, see: end of section 4).

4. Context, additional info about the target site and my macro: 

A sudden wave of nostalgia hit me, and I started to play again with a 19 year old Hungarian browser-based online RPG which I really enjoyed as a teen. Currently, I'm progressing with the quests. However, because only a few die-hard fans play the game anymore, making money is quite difficult because of a lack of ingame economy, so the only solution left is ""farming"" gold (meaning doing repetitive tasks to get items that I can sell in the game's own shop itself so I can generate gold without the need to trade with other players on the ingame marketplace).

I already succesfully wrote several ""farming"" macros that combine both JavaScript and iMacros (this is the main reason I'm using an older build with Pale Moon, due to the need for JS support). This means that the macro automates an ingame activity called mining, and my player character automatically mines ores with various value to sell. However, after a while, my inventory overflows with heavy and cheap ores, taking up much space from the ligher and more expensive ones, such as diamonds etc. When this occurs, a new interface comes in, telling me that I'm carrying too much stuff and I need to throw away something (this currently requires manual intervention on my part, meaning my macro is not fully automated). My target code provided in section 2 is this problematic interface which lists all the amount (""x pcs.""), and items (""ITEM3, ITEM4 and ITEM5"") in my bag and ask me to select with the checkbox what I want to throw away with a submit form. ""ITEM3, ITEM4 and ITEM5"" are the heavy and cheap stuff I want to automatically dispose of, so my macro can run in a loop and keep only the expensive items.

Also, because this is a PHP/JS-based online game, the array of items in my inventory are generated by the game and therefore dynamic, so I guess the onClick=""cuccArray[x]=1-cuccArray[x]; attribute of the checkbox I want to select cannot really be predicted/automated, because if the items in my inventory change, the array can be numbered completely differently.

5. Closing thoughts

I deliberately chose not to include any of my macros I experimented with, because I tried so many combinations that I wouldn't even know which one to write here. So if this seems as lazy to anyone, please forgive me. Thank you for everyone who went through my post, I would really appreciate some help. Even if my goal cannot be achieved because of the HTML structure, I would like to know it, because otherwise I will keep trying and failing. It might have started out as silly nostalgia but now the idea of me not being to solve the macro is bugging me even more than my love for that old browser RPG. I also really hope that the solution is not something really easy because I would feel very dumb (as I've mentioned, I've already succesfully did scripts and macros for other parts of this game, so I can use iMacros on at least a basic level).",https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=31442&sid=117ef7144580822f4982137e21eddfc2,automat

Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=BUTTON ATTR=ARIA-EXPANDED:false&&ARIA-HASPOPUP:true&&CLASS:vcMenuBtn&&TYPE:button&&ARIA-LABEL:More<SP>options&&PBI-FOCUS-TRACKER-IDX:1&&TXT:

I am using above code to extract google search result as csv format. The code has no issue. Problem is after running the loops 7 times or generally 13 times or any random times captcha comes (I am not robot) and I need pause the loop to solve captcha manually. I am expecting to implement captcha solution in my code so each time captcha comes imacros solve it automatically and the the code runs without interrupt . As you can see I am using csv file as input to run google search which contain 2000+ rows so I can not sit and solve captcha manually.

I have search for solution in this forum and got info that may be I have to buy a captcha solution service but do not know how it will work with  my current iim file as the captcha comes suddenly rather than the site which contains a form with I am a robot captcha always there.

Thank You

1097,Variable reading and timeout loop,"Hi everyone! I'm just got iMacros cause I need it to create a bot for my economical simulator. In this game, you have to fight 10 times a day and work once to get paid.
If there are people who want to help, I would really appriciate it.
The theory it's simple, but I have no ideea how to write the code.

My plan is to write this bot that it can automatically fight 10 times, with a break of 10 minutes between each fight. I could do this by simply recording the macro, but there are some problems.
I can't beat someone who has more energy than me. So, I'm looking for a code that can read my victim's energy, and if the number is bigger than 5 (for example), than return and find another one who has less.
I've put here a printscreen that shows how this menu looks. The code should read vitim's energy from this menu, check if it is bigger than 5 and return to the list for searching another one with less energy. Or if it's possible to figure out from the begining the one that has less than 5% energy, why not.
I've thought that going by inspect element in chrome may help me. I located the line where energy is displayed, but I have no ideea how to write the code.

I've started building this code, but it can only do simple tasks cause I dont know how to improve it yet.

You can notice here that I copied the tasks because there are 10 fights to do and I want the macro to keep running. As I said, there is a timeout of 10min between fights, and I added that with a difference of couple seconds 
so I'm safe from getting banned, cause they could check that I'm doing my fights every day at the same interval. I will keep editing this timeout.
So, besides variable reading, I would also need a loop with an timeout of 10min between each task group.

I really want to learn some coding commands, as a begginer. If you guys can help me with that, I would really appriciate it.

As a summary, I need a code for reading variables who can chose the victim that has the energy under 5% and a loop one, with a timeout of 10mins between each fight, who would simplify that long code.
A tested fight, is defined by that:

1098,Extract image path from table,"Specialty electrics draw eyes at July series CHICAGO -- Whether it was the free food or the products themselves, lots of the buyers in the NHMA Mid-Year Show here gravitated toward stalls with specialty kitchen electrics.

>> http://bitly.com/best-masticating-juicer
On display were an variety of appliances such as pastamakers, ice cream makers, breadmakers, cappuccino/espresso makers, juicers and waffle irons. While producers touted their goods, fresh bread, pasta, ice cream, cappuccino and espresso were prepared and served directly before the eyes -- and upset -- of attendees.
Judging from the numbers watching the food preparations take place, the interest level in the specialty market was large. And, many manufacturers agreed that the desire for specialty items is slowly increasing. However, according to some producers, only a few of the items now in the specialty niche are expected to profit from the increase in interest. In fact, most manufacturers of specialty products agreed that items such as pasta makers and ice cream manufacturers are leveling off either because of saturation in the market or because of what they predict overspecialization.

According to Lou Federico, divisional manager of kitchen products at Conair Corp., pastamakers and ice cream manufacturers are weakening. The reason, he explained, is these products need too much time and effort from consumers while delivering relatively few benefits and little convenience.
""We (Conair Corp.) have been assessing new niche categories. The market for pastamakers appears to be retrenching. Ice cream makers have also weakened. The biggest hangup in retail with ice cream manufacturers is the fact that it takes a lot of work to make something that's simpler to purchase already made."" Galileo Buzzi-Ferraris, president of Lello Appliances, distributor of Simac goods, concurred that interest in pastamakers is subsiding. He clarified that the availability of fresh pasta in many grocers' freezers has diminished the need for customers to exert the time and effort to make pasta at home.
Buzzi-Ferraris' view is that""the high-end ice cream business has been screwed-up when Donvier introduced its guide ice cream maker, which retails for just about $30."" Consequently, he said, prices for the whole marketplace were reduced. ""Now to sell huge numbers of (high end ) ice cream machines is quite hard,"" he added.

>> https://medium.com/@bestmasticatingjuic ... 01a47a8d59
In response to the Donvier unit, Simac is now offering the Gelato Pronto; a $79 manual ice cream maker. In accordance with Buzzi-Ferraris the reduced priced device is selling quite well. As for Donvier, federal sales manager Alice Shoemaker responded,""I don't believe we screwed it up,"" referring to reduced priced ice cream manufacturers. ""I think what we have done is altered the marketplace.""

Tom Fletcher, vice president of advertising at Gourmet Housewares, distributor of a line of Gaggia products, including a manual ice cream maker, also disagreed with Buzzi-Ferraris. He argued that lower priced ice cream manufacturers really extend the market. According to Fletcher,""There is a big difference between a $30 ice cream manufacturer and also a $600 unit"" He added that customers who purchase one would not be interested in the other.
One area where the two Gaggia's Fletcher and Simac's Buzzi-Ferraris did agree is the fact that cappuccino/espresso manufacturers are strong and should continue to rise tremendously. To fulfill the consumer demand for specialty coffee manufacturers, the two companies are marketing new blend cappuccino/espresso machines. ""Right now,"" said Fletcher,""cappuccino/espresso machines are in vogue, probably because customers are traveling more and therefore are exposed to various sorts of coffees. The American people as a whole is growing more sophisticated regarding the consumption of coffee and consequently they are looking for variety.""

Buzzi-Ferraris agreed. ""The cappuccino/espresso marketplace is big, and it is getting even larger. We are responding to this growing market by developing a fully automatic device that will make it even simpler to make espresso and cappuccino coffees. We'll introduce our newest cappuccino/espresso machine at the January Housewares Show (1990)."" According to Conair's Lou Federico, juicers and juice extractors are different examples of specialty items with growth potential.

>> https://www.facebook.com/Bestmasticatingjuicers.zones
""I visit two merchandise trends, first there is the juicer that squeezes out the juice of soft fruits and vegetables -- for example, oranges, grapefruits and berries. Then there's the juice extractor which pulls out juices from fruits and vegetables that don't seem juicy -- for instance, carrots, pears and apples. I think the products are being driven by the health trend, which has been around for a while and the diet craze, which frequently requires drinking considerable quantities of juices""
Presently, Conair Corp. is advertising a juicer and based on Federico, can be looking seriously at juice extractors. As with other manufacturers, Federico agreed that the secret to manufacturing specialty goods is twofold. ""Specialty electrics must provide benefits and conveniences,"" said Federico. ""If we (Conair) look at a specialty merchandise, we ask ourselves,'Can it be providing a benefit?' And'Can it be providing a benefit?' If the solution is no, we're not interested.""

He added,""We looked at breadmakers and decided it was too specialized. The final result is a small amount of bread which requires numerous hours to bake.""
On the flip side, Keizo Kawanishi, executive vice president of Zojirushi America Corp., pointed out that not all breadmakers are equally. By way of example, he said the Zojirushi breadmaker provides consumers versatility, he noted is an aspect many customers are searching for in specialty products.
""Other companies,"" explained Kawanishi,""have components that just bake bread. Our apparatus can bake cakes, bread and make jams. A great deal of people at the (Mid-Year) Show showed interest in our breadmakers. Consumers often get breadmakers for individual use, and later purchase them as presents.""",https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=29396&sid=7ae4e60bc4f3ad89d3e546c9096547af,automat

1104,Trimming a word off the extract value using EVAL + .substr?,"iMacros for Firefox 9.0.3//Firefox 49.0.2//Windows 10 Pro [Eng]

So I'm going a little nuts here. I haven't used iMacros in a long time (last post on this account was 2011) and I seem to have forgotten a lot. But I had a problem automating some link clicking and I thought, hey that old iMacros extension might work! So here I am.

So my end goal for my script is to click on several hyperlinked downloads (.torrent files) to automate the downloading process for me.

First problem:
The amount of torrents on the page change, depending on what specific page you're looking at. Some pages on the site may have 7 torrents, others have 2.
Luckily the site lists the amount of torrents on a page in a text attribute (literal text is 'Torrents x').
So first, I need to extract the 'x'. Through quite a bit of searching, it seems the best way to do this is using EVAL + javascript to manipulate the extraction. I settled on using substr because I only need the last value for the extraction and the word Torrents is always the same amount of characters. This is what I have so far:
Code: Select allSET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO
TAG POS=1 TYPE=LI ATTR=TXT:Torrents:<SP>* EXTRACT=TXT
SET !VAR1 EVAL(""'{{!EXTRACT}}'.substr(10,1);"")
PROMPT {{!var1}}
Now, I know that I've got some wrong syntax in there, I'm just not fully understanding where it's at/what is wrong. I know it's something with the EVAL because if I just use SET !VAR1 {{!EXTRACT}} instead of the EVAL in the same code, I get the prompt: Torrents: x. So everything's working, all I want is the correct syntax for trimming Torrents:<SP> off and having VAR1=x.
--------------------------
My second problem (getting ahead of myself a bit here but better to ask now I guess):
This is the line of code to click on the download links. Basically there are multiple instances of this text on the page, all corresponding to links to different torrents. Each torrent link looks like this: 
[DownLoad]
So to find those links and click on them I use:
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:DownLoad
TAG POS=2 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:DownLoad
TAG POS=3 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:DownLoad
etc...
What I need is to use the VAR1 from my first problem above and have it define the maximum amount of TAG POS to use. Basically if there's 23 torrents on the site, I need it to run:
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:DownLoad
...
TAG POS=23 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:DownLoad.
How would I go about doing that? I understand I can use TAG POS={{!var1}} to find the final DownLoad but I'm not sure how to use that to count up or how to design it so it stops the code after a certain amount.

Hopefully I explained myself clearly enough, if you need anymore information feel free to ask me to clarify. There's probably a much simpler way of doing this but I'm obviously clueless as to what it is.",https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=28323&sid=01bf0edf807fd3d4bb507a35b87155ad,automat
1105,"Download pdf/audio/video from page, click next page do same","Dear friends, I hope I can find some help, is my first time with imacros (I know algorithms, but I've never used imacros).

I am a participant in a website with videos and study material in pdf, and I want to download them so I can watch and study offline.

So, I'm logged into the page, and I'm going to the course I want to download, link:
https: //www.****.com/course/cod/sc%6CTU1EaL7Z%9W/v/OQlrb2uhlnS%9W/c/KvcHnMerTdz%9W

I tried, with Chrome Imacros recording function of imacros to save  each action and repeating it to do the operation in next pages, I'll attach the script so you understand.

In the page, I download the video, I use the Adobe HDS / HLS Video Saver addon (withou imacros i can download any m3u8 with this addon), the link to open the addon is:
chrome-extension://pibndofbpkoaipoidbkephfhhnapkccn/download.html

Is possible record actions of a another addon? even if this addon is just a new tab with specifc functions?
In this link, the m3u8 file is brought by clicking on the link inside the addon, the addon joins the parts and the download of a unified file of the video.
Then I click clear and close the tab.

I go back to the first page, and I click to download the pdf booklet and then click to download the pdf slide and after downlaod the audiofile.

Then I click on the next page, where there same structure page with a new video and other materials and I have re-created the process on this new page.

However the script is static, I want to leave it dynamic, to go on going on each page by clicking the ""next page"" button and the materials being downloaded in each one.

Another detail, that in the static there are some problems, in this part:
GOTO URL = chrome-extension://pibndofbpkoaipoidbkephfhhnapkccn/download.html

imacros adds  ""http://"" and ignores after the ""extension"" the "":"" and try to open in the new tab like this, imacros try open this:
http://chrome-extension//pibndofbpkoaip ... nload.html

1 - How do I open it in the new tab exactly ""chrome-extension://pibndofbpkoaipoidbkephfhhnapkccn/download.html""    ?

2 - inside this addon page which is a new tab, it seems that imacros did not save the command to click on the link, which makes the addon download the m3u8 and merge all the videos into a single file.
So in this way, as the addon is not opened as per the link above, I can not download the m3u8 video. Its possible use this addon with imacros? if not, any another suggestions to download m3u8 using imacros?

3 - When imacros downloads the contents of this first page, it goes to the next page according to the next page button, but it does not downloads the contents of the second page, but download the contents of the same first page again.
How to make it go to the next page as the button and download the contents of the next page and not the first?

That is, I want to make this dynamic, I did the procedure 3 times to be easy to understand the static imacro to try to make it dynamic.
So I want do a dynamic imacro that will always click ""next page"" automatically regardless of how many pages it is and download the contents of each one of them.

In short, for the time being this static script can download the pdfs and the audio normally, is only with the problem that I mentioned in not downloading the contents of the next page and too the problem of not being able to download the m3u8 video with imacros using the HLS addon.

S.O. Windows 8.1 Pro
plug in: iMacros for Firefox 9.0.3 (updated April, 24. 2017)

-----------------------

Hello, 

First of all , sorry for my bad english. 

I'm having an issue extracting TXT when in the middle of the text to extract there are Bold or Italic characters. It happens with Firefox plugin.

iMacros program works properly

I've changed the demo page (http://demo.imacros.net/Automate/Extract2) HTML to test if the problem was caused for the web page where I want to extract The text.

I've added bold characters in the middle of the phrase like this:
""The second line is extracted too"" for ""The second line is extracted too"".

In HTML: 

<td style=""width: 52%; outline: 1px solid blue;"" class=""bdytxt"">
 This line is extracted.<br>
 The <strong>second line</strong>
 is extracted, too.
</td>

Running this macro:

the result is: 

This line is extracted.
TheThis line is extracted.

instead of:

The second line is extracted, too.


It seems as the extracted text repeats himself when finds the bold tag (<strong>)

I also want it to check if the website is already logged in and if not than login (website times out after like 10-20 minutes or so). What I have written so far is the macro opens up my gmail, clicks on an e-mail with a subject verbiage that I have provided then I open a 2nd Tab, navigate to the URL and Login. All this works however the below is what im missing that i'm unable to figure out:

1 - Scan gmail until the e-mail with that specific subject line is available (I dont actually need to click on the e-mail, i just need to know its available as this will be my trigger to navigate to a website).
2 - If e-mail available, navigate to the website but if the site directs me back to the login page than login (I have the login macro all setup just need to know how to identify if website is logged in or not).
3 - I dont want the macro to keep looping through if an e-mail is found and the website is open. only loop (scan) if e-mail not available and website (tab-2) closed.

Below is what I have so far. If anyone could provide assistance that would be appreciated. BTW, my gmail is set to Basic HTML as I read that would be better for iMacro. I'm open to opinions on this as well.

I only want to accomplish a simple task that is to detect a certain content from a page. Sorry i dont know what terms to use maybe ill just explain it a bit more.

Pls bear with me here is an image of what the website script does and what i want to accomplish



this is how the code on the website looks like
Code: Select all<form action=""#"" method=""get"" id=""form1"">
 Guess the 1st letter of my name: <input type=""text"" name=""gletter""><br>
</form>

<button type=""submit"" form=""form1"" value=""Submit"">Submit</button>

<div class=""data-outcome item"">
   <!-- ajax result -->
</div>


everytime you press submit a result will show inside <!-- ajax result --> and the code will be
Code: Select all <div class=""inner-item"">
   <div class=""icon-correct"">W<span></span></div>
</div>


if i guess it correctly and
Code: Select all<div class=""inner-item"">
   <div class=""icon-lose"">L<span></span></div>
</div>


if i guess it wrong

so the code looks like this after every guess
Code: Select all<div class=""data-outcome item"">
        <div class=""inner-item"">
            <div class=""icn-win"">W<span></span></div>

1121,Loop through results,"Hi everyone.

I need to extract data from a site. There is a simple SELECT option, an INPUT, and a SEARCH BUTTON. So far so good.

Now, the result pages, are not paginated in the traditional way. There is no link to Page 1/2/...., only next page button, which is an input, and it acts like a submit. This input has a NAME attribute, which, on the last page is missing. This is fine with me, because the macro will stop automatically once finished. 

I need to go through all the pages, and extract the data. Now bear with me, I've started to look into iMacros only yesterday, so I'm not really familiar with all the options..

1122,Automate a filling form with a massive .csv in a table,"Hello!
- iMacros Version: 8.9.70.419
- Browser:Firefox: 47.0.1
- OS: Windows 10 Pro

I need your help regarding the performance of this script I have built in iMacros. It's doing sort of what I intend, sort of  
I want to load some basic information in a couple of text boxes everytime I click on the element (where the loop should be placed)
ctl00_PlaceHolderMain_BandejaEntidades_LstBandejaEntidades_ctrl{{!LOOP}}_LbtnVer.

The issues I'm having are the following:

1. The table where the data is located only displays 10 elements (although I can click on an index below the table that jumps through every 10 elements= This is called TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:354) . I want to loop over 3500 items. In addition to that, and to make things worse, the number of elements grow everyday but backwards: every new element starts at ""PlaceHolderMain"" in 0 so the first element that was loaded months ago will be the last on the list. But let's ignore this for a moment, so say I want to loop from 1 to 3500 elements, but since it only displays 10 elements, I get an error in the loop, because it cannot find the element 11, for example. How can I loop this to ALL the elements?

2. When I put the condition: SET !SINGLESTEP YES the code seems to work fine (assuming I just want to loop 10 elements, which I AM NOT!, because of the problem aforementioned). However, this is extremely tedious, I just want to run this and get over it. But the code get stuck when it encounters the line FRAME F=1. Not a runtime error, not running out of time, it just stops! Any idea why and how it can be solved?

3. The server response is extremely slow, every step when it makes a call to the server takes about 30-40 seconds. I've tried countless times to solve this with the IT people, but it seems that I cannot expect anything much from them  Ignoring this, how can I make the script run a little bit faster? Specially the part when it fills out the form and then returns to the main table?

4. When the first loop of filling out the form I got the headers of the .csv file, not the second line that I intended. But since SET !DATASOURCE_LINE {{!LOOP}} would loop every line starting from the element 1, this mean I would have to make another loop? So DATASOURCE starts at 2 but the rows on the table will start at 1 (actually, 0)? I'm really confused right now. Any idea how to solve this? It is my understanding that I would need to create a Javascript file? but I have no idea how to do this!

If someone can give me a hand orientating me on this issues, Im more than grateful!

I have searched for some time to find out why I cannot get comma and quotes delimited data being saved to the .csv file.

Can you please advise what I am doing wrong here.

Any assistance is much appreciated.

1125,FAIL_IF_FOUND on Checkbox value,"Hi there..

I am VERY new to iMacros, and am so far very impressed.  
As I am only trialling the product at present I am using the free version. (v11)

I am using the product to create automated regression testing, and so checking results is a key element of my macros.

I am currently trying to run a macro which proves whether or not a check box on a page has been ticked.

If the checkbox is not ticked (or is ticked, whichever) I want the Macro to error (FAIL_IF_FOUND?)

I am not sure the best way to accomplish this.  I had it working using image search, but the free version does not include this feature.

How do I extract the value of a checkbox, and then fail the Macro if the value is either YES or NO?

Windows 8.1, IE11

1127,Case for the Pros - Help with Looping & Excluding,"I am completely new to Imacros and I might need some help from you 

My plan is to automatically sent a message to specific users on an online marketplace.

I would like to have a script for that which allows me to execute whenever I need it.

First, go to this website: http://www.kapaza.be

Enter a search term: for example ""iphone 4""

Brings you here --> http://www.kapaza.be/nl/belgie?ca=0&l=0 ... =3&ps=&pe=

Then click on the Headline of every single result, scroll down the page and sent me message to the user by filling in: Name, E-Mail, Phone & Question. The Button to sent the message is  ""Verstuur je Bericht"" 

See here --> http://www.kapaza.be/nl/telefonie-acces ... 928109.htm

Now the tricky part comes...

1. How can I skip offers which have certain words in the Offer Headline? ( I only want to contact people who sell something and not those who are looking to buy an Iphone)
- For example words like: ""looking for"", ""Buying"" etc

2. How can I implement a function which checks if a member has already been contacted. I don麓t want to sent the same message twice to the same user. I was thinking to save every Offer Headline to an excel / csv file after the member has been contacted. If the script goes into the Offer it checks if Offer Headline is in the csv File. If yes --> skip. Maybe there麓s an easier option for this. Any help here is appreciated.

3. How can I run the script over several different pages. I don麓t want to stop if the script hits the last result on page 1.

Hope someone is able to help me with this!

Here麓s some additional info:

1129,Selective Search and Export to CSV,"Hello Team,

Firstly, thanks a million for making iMacros. Its the best thing I found to manage my work. I will skip to the query.

Please help me with the problem I am facing. I have reviewed many (really lot of) articles on this forum but my lack of knowledge in programming makes it very tough to understand the technical jargons used, or direct info provided without any explanations on why something needs to be where.

I am sorry, I could not find/understand how to find and sort selective data from one page,, and extract into selected(dedicated) columns to manage my portfolio.
[I use firefox(45.0.1)+iMacros plugin(just installed plugin yesterday so it should be the most/latest available. I use Windows7. I am clueless on programming and hence request you to kindly help me with some comments for the iMacros script that will be shown.]

I have been trying to extract data from only 2 columns of this webpage for randomly selected stocks from this link:
https://www1.nseindia.com/live_market/d ... market.htm

Now the code starts like this:
URL GOTO=https://www1.nseindia.com/live_market/d ... market.htm
鈥?The second command below is to be sorting the table by the symbol so that I can review later easily.
TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:Symbol

{{Above, the link is first opened and then I sort the table by the Symbol (alphabetically)}}

The problem is when I make an iMarco by selecting the column in the table, it gets a POS<ID> today, and tomorrow it may change.

[For example, when I select 鈥楤HEL鈥?as shown below, I get 飪?TAG POS=124 TYPE=TD ATTR=* EXTRACT=TXT.   The problem is the POS124 keeps changing dynamically and there is no way to track them. It can happen monthly or weekly, that the POS124 becomes POS138 tomorrow for that stock.]

I am looking for a few things as listed below:
鈥?The iMacro should automatically search for the term 鈥楤HEL鈥?in the first column and then pull its value(from price column), irrespective of the POS<ID> it holds for this month/week.
鈥?If I decide to monitor 5 stocks(like shown below in red), the iMacros should automatically push the time-stamp in column1 and then populate the 5stocks鈥?values in col2/3/4/5/6.
鈥?The iMacros should run until the system time becomes 3PM. 

Please suggest what scripts need to be added.

Here is a screenshot of the 2 columns.






I would be very very grateful to have any help or suggestions on this one.

2. JPG files.

This script has been worked.

The question that makes me confused.
1. how can I generate a csv file which only the file name only, without the full URL. example 656757657h576567.jpg
2. how that can change the file name 656757657h576567.jpg automatically according to the title of the article?

1137,Extracting a First name from a LinkedIn Profile,"Hi - bit of  newb at this.

So I'm currently workiong a lot with LinkedIn for my job, and a guy at work suggested imacro as an easy and quick way to automateextracting contact detailsfrom LinkedIn, and save it as a file so ican use it to mailshot through Microsoft office. So far it works great - but...

I'm not trying to fix what ain't broken, but i started playing around, and trying to polish my method, and tried to get imacro to extract the first name from a Linked Profile page and save it with the corresponding email address (allowing me to personalise every email). I can do the FULL name with ease, but I'm admitting defeat with the first name extraction.

What I'd like to be able to do is pass {{address}} and {{zipcode}} to a simple scraping macro to tell me if any results show up and what they are if any.  The problem is that I can't seem to figure out how to anticipate where to look for the results because of the frames.

Any suggestions?

I also tried the Demo-download Macro, and the issue is similar, I don't reach the last webpage as the macro waits, once the download is finished.
If I click any of the button on the box IE pops once download is over, suggesting me to Open the file, the folder, or just cancel, the macro will go on.

I am pretty sure it is easy, but I can't figure it out...

I read the thread found here: http://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=2355

It basically says you might automate the download by preventing the browser from opening the PDF. But after attempting to follow the instructions (they are somewhat outdated), and researching on my own how to disable a PDF from opening in a browser, the pesky PDF still loads in the browser.

Has anyone figured out how to deal with this problem or similar? Thanks for your time.

I have a macro that downloads trademark data from the Belarus trademark office website. Each fetched trademark is saved as a complete web page and all downloaded marks are post processed by an other program to extract all relevant trademark data.

The new version now contains the header <META content=""text/html; charset=windows-1251"" http-equiv=Content-Type> which results in a saved file of type DOS where all Cyrillic characters are malformed.
When saving the page manually with Internet Explorer you can switch the encoding from Cyrillic (Windows) to Unicode (UTF-8) to resolve this problem.

If this is at all possible, please let me know, even if I can only do it for only one specific page to another, would be very helpful. If this functionality is not there by default but can be added, any pointers would be much appreciated.

1163,"New to Macro programming, Quick initial question","I have a basic programming background, and am willing to learn the necessary steps of writing a proper macro on my own, contingent upon the answer to this question. I'm planning on using iMacros for Firefox on Windows 7 or Mac OSX 10.6.8 (I have both available), and I'm curious if what I'm about to describe is possible.

This is the website I want to scrape for names: http://www.faseb.org/The-Directory/Sear ... ctory.aspx. I want to collect information about employees at certain organizations by running a search and selecting the link for their name. The link to THAT webpage is what holds most of the information I want. However, it's easy enough to filter by an institution name, but there is no unique URL for a page with a specific list of results. This posed a problem for my normal scraping software (outwit hub), where I used that program to write a macro that would work, if not for the fact that at the start of the execution of the macro, it loads the original page URL first (which always results in the default search page, AKA a blank page with no results). Selecting the ""search"", ""clear"" and the "">>"" buttons on the page don't load unique URLS, so makes me think that the database is just an active query or something, which makes automating using the program I have (outwit) a problem. 

Could I write a macro using iMacros for Firefox on either a Windows 7 machine or a Mac running Windows 7 or Mac OSX 10.6.8 that would allow me to extract data from a search described above while cycling through the resulting links on each page of the search? I'm sorry if this sounds a bit technically illiterate or beginnerish. Normally I would just say, ""hey why not just jump in and if I discover it's not possible a couple days in it was worth the experience"", but this is more of a time issue since I would need to have these contacts available by next week. Thank you for any help and I appreciate your patience with me!",https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=22652&sid=764a56e3c04defae9b390be083f6af7b,automat
1164,Image recognition within a defined scope,"Hello,
I want to automate keystrokes on a virtual keyboard.
The virtual keyboard is easily recognized with the following:
IMAGECLICK POS=1 IMAGE=virtualKB.bmp CONFIDENCE=95
But things become more difficult when I try to recognize a key belonging to the keyboard.
My question:
Is it possible to conduct the recognition of a particular key by limiting  the scope of the search to the keyboard (previously recognized) in order to reduce the number of false found ?
Keys on the keyboard are randomly scattered.

1165,Scraping text/links from specific web page <div> section to clipboard?,"[EDITED after feedback - sorry for the long post, trying to input all relevant information...]

I've been working on a project for a couple of years (it's a continual thing, so it's never-ending).
I've progressed to a point of using mouse/keyboard macros to scrape a list of text/links from a set of variable-length pages, to paste into Excel; then run an Excel macro to manipulate that data; then return to the webpage, close it & repeat on the next one (I have some error-checking in place in case of a failure).
I do this every 6 months or so.

I am scraping about *75,000 cemetery index pages on http://www.billiongraves.com, copying the names/dates/links of the people interred there, then sorting, filtering and eventually editing errors & merging duplicate records.
*FYI - there are about 600,000 cemetery pages, but I do some data preparation first, extracting only the 75,000 pages with data on them.

Recently, because of some minor site changes and Firefox add-in customizations, the macros that I painstakingly created over time (to pixel-perfect page coordinates, with JitBit Macro Recorder) need to be shifted & changed, which will take me a week or more to do.  It's painful...

I'm thinking of iMacros as an alternative (or as an additional part of the process), as I would LIKE TO do the following, but am not sure it's capable of this.
A typical page has a particular <div><id> section which shows the data I want - it would be ideal if I could select JUST that <div> section and copy all of its contents at once, to the clipboard, which I can then paste into Excel.
*right now, my macro is scrolling & selecting specifically-positioned lines depending on the length of the list...

So I'm looking for this very basic need first, as I can build up more functionality around it later as I learn more about iMacros.

EXAMPLE PAGE: https://billiongraves.com/site-map?ceme ... 295&page=0 - in the Page Source is the section:
Code: Select all	<div id=""content"">
        <h1 style=""margin: 10px 0 25px 10px;"">BillionGraves Site Map</h1>
        <div class=""card"">

            <div style=""border-bottom:#CCC thin solid; width:916px;""> </div>

        </div>


My hope is that in selecting 'the entire block' - i.e. the whole <div> section - I can copy all the contents in one shot, rather than having macros scroll to the bottom to capture all the lines, which is not yet working 100% perfectly.

Is iMacros able to select a specific page section (edit: I have found that it can) and copy the hyperlink contents to clipboard or a file?  I see that it can extract content to a CSV file, for example (edit: in the paid version, not the freeware one).  This could work for me (if it creates a 2-column file, with the TEXT and also the LINK - really NEED both!), as I could later combine the CSVs and import to Excel in bulk.
*If the functionality is there to quickly/easily copy a defined <div> section, I'm happy to pay the $99 for the basic version to allow me to SAVEAS a file...

Any help or direction appreciated.

All demo macros work fine


I have tried relentlessly over the past week to adjust my script so it only scrapes followers that themselves have at least a certain amount of followers. One of my accounts get spammed persistent and I simply need to filter out the noise from real meaningful followers

The following script does in fact work quite well down only to one problem, the loop. It runs fine all the way to the extract tag position and than instead of grabbing the actual tag of the current loop it somehow takes the next one instead. I even utilized the great idea about the loop-switch posted in the forum to jump out if a condition is not met

What it currently does is to filter out all my followers that have themselves at least 400+ followers and writes it into the csv file. Perhaps CONTENT=MOUSEOVER is wrong but I am not sure.

PROBLEM 1: the first TAG POS is working correctly, however further down the TAG POS should still be in the same LOOP iteration but it is not, it is taking the next found TAG instead.

PROBLEM 2: SAVEAS EXTRACT does not write the extract each into a new line inside the csv file but simply all into one line.

I would greatly appreciate some help to hopefully get it solved as I am out of ideas on this one. Thank you

First of all, apologies for my naivety in this subject. I'm still pretty new to all this.
Basically I'm looking to write a code that goes to a user on a website, and if it finds the words 'Status: Online' it saves the username to an online.txt file, and if the username is offline it saves it to a offline.txt file, and then moves on to the next username, which would be given by {{!COL2}}.
Now I understand that the macro is searching for Status: Online or Status: Offline, but then the extract command is mutually exclusive regardless of whether or not it finds the text on the page anyway.
Thus when I run the script, it saves the username to both the Online file, and the Offline file.
Here's what I have so far:
Code: Select allSET !DATASOURCE filter.csv
SET !LOOP 1
SET !DATASOURCE_LINE {{!LOOP}}
FILTER TYPE=IMAGES STATUS=ON

I had several possible Solutions/Implementations in mind, but I think if I had had to implement that Functionality for myself, I would have gone for 'indexOf()' for the 3 Separators, + 'push()' to an Array with a Check on 'indexOf()'>=0 (Char/String not found returns ""-1""), and then with 'Math.min()' or 'sort()' on the Array to return the lowest 'indexOf()' Value (>0) to reuse with 'substr()' or 'substring()' on the original Extract...

The only way I have found that kind of works is to append a 'spacer' (""//"") after each extract, which at least allows me to count back the number of columns to reformat with the missing info, and then deleting all the placeholder columns.

Is there not a better way?

iMacros still extracts data according with the its tag positioning and the DOM structure of the ""0 items exist"" page or gets #EANF# in the cases  it does not find a tag match on the page.
Then, iMacros saves the extracted that in a row of the extraction csv.


I wish to exclude from Code: Select allSAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT .csv the rows that belong to the ""0 items exist"" webpage (in other words my extracted CSV to show only the complete data extracted from the website).

First of all, I am using iMacros version 881205 with Firefox v 34.0.5 on Windows 7. I need to download data from a website such that I have to select (click on) Level A, which leads to Level B, clicking on which leads to Level C, which contains the required data (table). iMacros works perfectly for going back and forth between different levels, but I am facing trouble with saving the table, for which there is an option to download it as Excel (or PDF) from a drop down.

The actual trouble is not so much for downloading the table as Excel, as iMacros records that step as well:

TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=ID:ReportViewer_ctl05_ctl04_ctl00_ButtonLink
TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:Excel
TAB T=2
TAB T=1

(i did find a similar post http://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php? ... 742#p61655, but unfortunately it didn't provide a solution to my problem)

The problem occurs when it takes time to load the page (at Level C), the code gets stuck and shows error that TAB T = 2 does not exist. I guess this happens because when one clicks at the option to save as Excel, the browser opens a new tab (finding a way around this issue might as well solve my problem), and then closes it and returns to the original tab. 

To get over this issue, I have included WAIT SECONDS = 5 (or even a higher number) before this step, but sometimes when it takes longer than the specified number of seconds for a page to load, the whole thing just stops. Also, this is not a very efficient solution as I am making the program wait every time even when the page has loaded, and when the page actually takes time to load, this does not provide any help.

I also tried WAIT SECONDS = (10 | #DOWNLOADCOMPLETES) but it does not work. I have increased !TIMEOUT_PAGE and have SET !ERRORIGNORE YES.

The way I see it, I believe a possible solution could be to somehow avoid the TAB = 2 TAB = 1 steps altogether (?), or to write an IF condition for the code to enter TAB = 2 only when the page has loaded completely (?).

As I mentioned above, my coding skills are very limited and maybe not up to the task. So, I hope this forum can provide some solution to my problem. Also, please do tell if there is no way to go around this issue using iMacros so that I may look for some other way to scrape the data (please suggest); or, if nothing works out, will have to get on with manually downloading the data (which would be a shame i suppose ).

Sorry for the longish post (better technical understanding may have reduced the length). I really appreciate your time and effort.",https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=23787&sid=b07178a8376ad918bdc99d345a2f0b97,condition

Ignored for the moment due to my confusion. 

Hello iMacros community.  I am absolutely amped to start using this product but I am overwhelmed trying to get a few couple computing statements working.  I'm not a completely novice programmer but I use mostly R and the syntax of making these statements work is running against my expectations. 

I will show you the code I have so far (only using the direct control instead of calling elements) with comments on what I'm trying to do. I've been reading through the wiki on how to approach these statements more than a couple times and now I think its time to ask for a little guidance even though I'm starting from an early stage.

After running the code elsewhere I can see that it is sensitive to the font and sizing of the browser so playing with it is necessary (duh). What I am trying to show is that I am doing the following order of steps

1. Go to the pubic court document website
2. click to search (I don't start out step one at the search form because the site is very painfully tracking my session)
3. Enter in my case code starting from 0. and click search
4. Click the first result
5. save the whole html file
6. repeat with the case number at 1,2, ...

Here is the TL:DR questions of my dilemma: 

Q1. How can I click dynamic links like I do in step 2 without using direct screen? (I found something on this under X/Y at http://wiki.imacros.net/First_Steps but I need a little more guidance as someone who has only finished the first half of javascript at code academy)

Q2. How can I run a ""while"" loop to conditionally only return cases that have links in step 4 (and hence, are real). 

Q3. Under Play, I can choose to either run a script or run a loop where I set the limit outside the script.  How can I set a limit to my loop within the script. 

Q4.  If I want to run multiple loops in one script with different limits how can I do this so the loop is contained within its respective code. 

Thanks.  And forgive my sloppy language for where more specific terms could have been used.",https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=22762&sid=7e74df639d022ccbaa0e92d884edcf30,condition

Hi, 
I am looking for a way to reduce the amount of statements when extracting data. It would be ideal if I could get it down to 2 statements for the lot...since this is a small section of a larger macro I would prefer not to go to .js but handle in .iim files.

1205,Extract (horrible) paged table with AJAX using Javascript,"This is not a question topic, I just would like to share the solution I used to extract info from a page using iMacro FF plugin.
First - iMacro is a fantastic product! I don't need the paid suite so far but I ordered my company to buy it because I will need it sooner or later and it totally worths every penny.
Second - the amount of information in the forum, the tech support and the examples are also fantastic! I built a solution in 2 days from scratch by reading everyone's else issues and solution. That's why I want to share mine, hope it can help others.

The issue: I have to extract to csv all the entries from this website - https://www.compras.rj.gov.br/publico/ (which only works on IE - blergh!)
If you click on the right table on ""10775 concluidas"" it will show a table on the center with the 10775 Licitacoes I have to extract info from.

I used the User Agent Switcher add-on for FF (https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-br/firefo ... -switcher/) to pretend I was in IE. A great add-on, by the way. For some reason in my experience iMacro works better with FF than Chrome or IE, and it has the built-in support for scripting using javascript. So, FF is the way.

The information is based on a paged table with 10 entries per page. I need some info that is showed when I click on each link. The page was designed using Ajax and javascript, so when you click the link it shows the information I need on the same page and div. This wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that when you click the ""Retornar"" button on the bottom of each detailed page to go back to the previous page with the 10 entries, it always goes to the very FIRST 10 entries. Horrible! I would have to navigate to the correct page each time I finished my 10 entries extraction. I was able to build a solution like that looping through JS and iMacro, but it would take around 20 days with more than 10,000 entries. Not sure if the reason for that is clear, one would have to test th page to better understand. For example, I started in the page 1 (1-10 entries) and extract the 10 entries as desired. Then I increment a variable (k) to run a 'pagechange' iMacro so I could get to the page 2 (11-20 entries). Issue is - when I click the ""Retornar"" button from the detailed entry 11, it does not takes me to Page 2, it takes me to Page 1! So, for instnce, in page 500, after I extract the details from entry 501, the ""Retornar"" button would take me again to page 1 and I would have to run the iMacro 'pagechange' 500 times to get to entry 502...hope the issue is clear.

As I said I developed a first solution using this option that would take 20 days. I will share if someone wants because it can be useful for some loop with JS learning:    
Code: Select allvar macro;

var k=0;
for (var j=1;j<1078;j++) { ///loop pelo numero de paginas
	for (var i=1;i<20;i++)	{ ///loop pelo numero de registros da tabela de cada pagina
			if (k>0) { ///ajusta a paginacao porque o codigo sempre retorna para a primeira pagina
				for (var p=0;p<k;p++) { ///vai para a pagina da vez
					iimPlay(""pagechange"");
				}
			}
		iimSet(""i"",i)
		iimPlay(macro)
		i = i+1
			if (i==20) {
				k++;
		}
	}
}


The final solution: I used the Firebug add-on to find out how the paging was being handled. It turns out to be a javascript function with 3 parameters. Then I used the command URL GOTO in iMacro to go to the correct page each time I needed, using a variable to loop through the top entry of each page. Below is the final solution, not sure if there's an easier or more straigth forward solution for this site. I know this one is working great and I hope it can be useful for someone with similar pages to scrape. In the end I successfully scraped the 10775 in a couple of hours.
Code: Select allvar macro;
macro =""CODE:"";

macro +=""SET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO""+""\n"";
macro +=""URL GOTO=javascript:paginacao('licitacoes_concluidas.asp','principal',{{k}})()""+""\n"";

var k=0;
for (var j=1;j<1078;j++) { ///loop pelo numero de paginas
	for (var i=1;i<20;i++)	{ ///loop pelo numero de registros da tabela de cada pagina
                iimSet(""k"",k)
		iimSet(""i"",i)
		iimPlay(macro)
		i = i+1
			if (i==20) {
				k=k+10;
		}
	}
}



I also did a rewing solution to scrape from the start to end, so I could finish it sooner. The rewind starts k with 10760 to go to the last page with 10 entries and the subtracts 10 on each loop:
Code: Select allvar macro;
macro =""CODE:"";

macro +=""SET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO""+""\n"";

var k=10760;
for (var j=1;j<1078;j++) { ///loop pelo numero de paginas
	for (var i=1;i<20;i++)	{ ///loop pelo numero de registros da tabela de cada pagina
                iimSet(""k"",k)
		iimSet(""i"",i)
		iimPlay(macro)
		i = i+1
			if (i==20) {
				k=k-10;
		}
	}
}



And, of course, the 'pagechange' macro from the first solution, not in use in the final solution anymore:

                           On Windows Xp Pro Ver 5.1 with service pack 3

heres what i need to be able to do:
open my first recordsource, loop through the data(.csv file), each record is an url that i want to goto,
then, open my second recordset, loop through each record and update the first recordset, based on what i have in the second...


here is what i've got so far......

var numberOfUrls = 1001
while(true){
for(var i=1;i<numberOfUrls;i++){
var macro = ""CODE: ""
macro+= ""SET !ERRORIGNORE YES""+""\n""
macro+= ""SET !REPLAYSPEED fast""+""\n""

macro+= ""SET !LOOP ""+i+""\n""
macro+= ""SET !DATASOURCE_LINE {{!LOOP}}""+""\n""
macro+= ""URL GOTO={{!COL1}}""+""\n""

the above works fine I can go to the url in column 1 and even manipulate the data there. 
But, what I need to be able to do is now open a second recordset and loop though all the records(1 per line) and update the first url, with col2 from the second recourd source
Heres my first problem, I cant seem to pass the value of !COL2 from the macro to the script

macro+= ""!VAR1={{!COL2}}""+""\n""	

iimPlay(macro)

//mycode =!VAR1

mycode=iimGetLastExtract()

window.alert(mycode)


	Then here instead of adding a single piece of data then looping on through the original first datasource, I need to be able to loop through the second data source and update each record in first datasource with any info in the COL i need to use


//macro+= ""TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:mytext""+""\n""
//macro+= ""TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=ACTION:group.php ATTR=NAME:myname CONTENT={{!VAR1}}""+""\n""

Hi,
 I extract data from a web page and in the last few months the frame number (no frame names that refer to table) seems to vary from numbers 14-18 every few days/weeks.  My work around now is to manually change number.  I would like to able to have macro handle that, but I can't figure out how to do it. The original macro has 300 lines of code and I need to access this particular frame twice, line 47 and then again at line 234.  Ideally the macro would determine frame number, then store in variable for second access.  I have searched the web and I know there are scripting solutions out there but I am confused/unsure how to specifically code and then incorporate script into the existing macro: ie: Run firstpart.iim, run framenumber.js, then run finalpart.iim??
Thanks

1218,Check if a CSS Selector exists on a webpage,"Hi all,
Preface:
-	I鈥檓 a beginner at coding, so your patience is appreciated   
-	Apologies if this isn鈥檛 the right forum group in which to post this question. I wasn鈥檛 quite sure where to put it.
-	I鈥檝e been looking for the answer to this question for several hours last night and this morning and couldn鈥檛 find it. If this type of question is already answered, I apologize for creating a redundant thread and would appreciate the link.
-	I tried very hard to include all the information required, as mentioned in the 鈥淧lease read this before reporting problems鈥?thread. Please go easy on me if I neglected to include some important information. I鈥檒l happily provide anything else that鈥檚 needed.

iMacros v10.1.0 for FF, 'Free', FF94 (v94.0.1 (64-bit)), Win10_ENG.

I want my script to be able to check to see if there鈥檚 a specific CSS Selector on a webpage. If it doesn鈥檛 exist, I want the script to continue. If it does exist, I want the script to extract the HREF/URL link from the selector, open up a new tab, go to the URL extracted from the selector, and then close the tab and return to the first tab.

The CSS selector in question is:
Code: Select allbody > div:nth-child(15) > a:nth-child(1)

I wrote this code out:
Code: Select allSET !ERRORIGNORE YES
SET !TIMEOUT_STEP 1
TAG SELECTOR=""body > div:nth-child(15) > a:nth-child(1)"" EXTRACT=HREF
TAB OPEN
TAB T=2
URL GOTO={{!EXTRACT}}
WAIT SECONDS=1
TAB CLOSE
SET !EXTRACT NULL
TAB T=1

The problem with this code is that if the selector doesn鈥檛 exist, the script will open a new tab and then freeze (even though I have SET !ERRORIGNORE YES), presumably because it doesn鈥檛 know what to do with !EXTRACT, which is NULL. This is why I need the script to be able to check if the selector is on the page (unless there's another solution of which I'm not aware).

Additionally, I鈥檓 running the free version of iMacros, which only allows for three custom variables. I鈥檓 already using three variables to generate a random number earlier in the script:
Code: Select allSET !VAR1 1
SET !VAR2 3
SET !VAR3 EVAL(""var randomNumber=Math.floor(Math.random()*\""{{!VAR2}}\"" +\""{{!VAR1}}\""); randomNumber;"")

Is it possible to perform the check for the CSS selector without using any variables? If not, is it possible to generate a random number without the three variables so I can then use them for the check?

Thank you for reading and for your help.  ",https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=31816&sid=ddad572d7e36bd7d9ce3abd083a6d173,specific

I am trying to make basic macros to communicate with a telegram bot 
I success with everything but, 
bot time to time communicate with ""are you sure"" and I should respond with ""yes or no /or/ are you a robot or not"" otherwise the process will fail
my point is, is it possible for imacros to communicate with the bot and check for a specific message and then decide to respond with a specific message?

like:

imacros writes: hello (and waits for a response): if the response back was the word ""hello"", then write.. example ""How are you""... 
if what wroten is not the word ""hello"" .. ""then respond with some word else or wait 25 seconds and try again"" etc..)

Problem:
I am trying to write an iMacros script that loads a webpage, fills out a form with the required attributes, searches, and from the search output table select a hyperlinked identifier (that changes every day) to open the page that allows me to download the CSV I need.

Ive managed to write the script to populate the form and search to produce the output I want to select. In the output table (attached capture) I want to select the hyperlinked value underneath 'OutpudId'. This I can do if I explicitly tell the script what to select but it changes everyday and I want the script to by dynamic to find the value in that position to then be able to select it day in day out.

TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:a0451cb7 ---- this is the variable I want to select. Hardcoded selects it but it changes every time the form is submitted


Ive attempted to use Extract in different ways to no success. Please see below:

or
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=TH ATTR=TXT:OutputId EXTRACT=TXT

1224,How to extract nested informations using XPATH?,"iMacros ver: 10.0.2.1450 (FREE), Firefox, Windows 10

Hello,
The objective is to extract the value of HTML DOM Property such as id,href and data-download-file-url for each of the images displayed from this [website][https://www.freepik.com/search?dates=an ... rt=popular]. I believe XPATH will be suitable for this task as each of the image can be accessed by the following generalise XPATH Code: Select all/html/body/main/section[2]/div/div/figure[X]/div

with the capital X indicate the Image label that take the value from 1 to 50, for the aforementioned website.

I know that, to extract the properties of Figure 1, for example, can be achieved by
Code: Select allTAG XPATH=""/html/body/main/section[2]/div/div/figure[1]""  EXTRACT=TXT

However, the line above outputted all DOM Property including the one that I am not interested with.

According to the tutorial  below;

[OP1][https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?t=26155]
[OP2][https://stackoverflow.com/questions/385 ... cros-xpath]

Extracting specific DOM property can be achieved by something like the following
Code: Select allTAG XPATH=""/html/body/main/section[2]/div/div/figure[1]/div[@id='showcase__content'] ""  EXTRACT=TXT

However, the execution instead give an error.

I really appreciate if someone can shed some light about this problem.",https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=30959&sid=117ef7144580822f4982137e21eddfc2,specific

imacros question
Posted by Focalav 禄 27/02/2020 - 18:46

HI all Im trying to do a data extract from a specific loaction, for a random bit of data using imacros.
Im trying to use a SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP query but the query structure is a mystery to me.
Ive read: http://wiki.imacros.net/SEARCH
but this doesn't explain enough so that I can figure out how to make it useful in building my own query.

A sample bit of the source webpage is:
Code: Select all<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=""220px""><div style=""width:200; height:25; background:url(/images/timedcombat-background.png); border:1px solid #000000;""></div></td><td>Next target: <b>6 seconds</b></i></td></tr></table>

So Ive tried: a whole bunch of stuff trying to figure out how the query structure works but I haven't go it.

Imacros Notes on using SEARCH REGEXP
Code: Select allSEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:..[^]"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: undefined
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:..[^s]"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: undefined
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:..[^0-9]"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: undefined

And I've reformatted a bit the Post, especially about the very last 'SEARCH' Statement that I separated from the previous ones, which seems to retrieve some iMacros Core Code about the 'EVENT' Mode... Hum..., strange indeed...

1234,Crawling a site to make site map,"Hi,

There's an informative site that does not provide a site map and I want to make one for my own use in referring to the information it provides. I'm looking to see if I can accomplish this with iMacros. What I need to do is crawl the site and extract the text and URLs for internal links on all its pages, saving them in some sort of tree that indicates the hierarchy of the links. Also, the site does have section menus in the left margin, and I could construct a full site map by just extracting those and knitting them together.

Is it possible to do that with the FireFox add-on?

As a brute-force method, I could also do it if I can just crawl all the links to URLs within the site and download the HTML for all pages and use a text editor to manually extract link tags and then arrange those in the proper order. I could do that if I just have the ability to crawl the links and download the pages.

I looked through the iMacros Wiki page on ""Data Extraction"" and didn't see anything on how to crawl a site. I searched the Wiki for ""crawl"" and for ""site map"" and got no results. I looked through the forum on ""How-To's and Examples for Web Scraping"" and didn't see anything that seems applicable. And I did a search in this forum (Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping) for ""crawl"" and ""site map"" and found one thread (http://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=3291) that referred to the Wiki page on Web Scripting, which apparently requires the Enterprise edition, which I don't have, and which also does not say anything directly about crawling.

So, two bottom line questions:
* Can a site be crawled using a free version of iMacros? 
* Is there documentation somewhere specifically on how to use iMacros to crawl a site?

Thanks for your help.

1. What version of iMacros are you using? - iMacros for Firefox 8.8.2

Problem:
I am trying to write an iMacros script that checks a webpage, and in that webpage checks a specific webpage position for a specific text that is positioned always to the right of a naming text that always has the same position on that webpage (naming text is: ""Location:"") where the value of this specific text to the right of that naming text can change between 1 to 26 different values (say: A-Z), Once iMacros ""reads"" this specific text, then have iMacros take that specific text and look it up in a specific Excel file where that specific text has specific values (say: A to Z) located in column A and then have iMacros return the corresponding output value from column B (say: 101-126) on the same row.
How would I script this in iMacros?

So far, using the iMacros built in recorder I have made the following progress in iMacros (webpage image with iMacros recorder ""blue boxes"" listed below):

I tried the below code, and this did not work.
Code: Select allURL GOTO=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office13\EXCEL.exe

EDIT: Progress Update
Courtesy of the wiki: http://wiki.imacros.net/URL; I was able to find the ""URL GOTO="" command for running local files in Windows.
Code: Select allURL GOTO=file:///C:\Directory\TEST.CSV

As a result, I was able initiate the running of an Excel (.CSV) file where the ""URL GOTO="" triggers the browser prompt window below. How would I code iMacros to open the local file, and not download it?

Using the code:

Allows me to extract the actual URL as: ""https://*/*.PDF""

But what code do I use to tell iMacros to:
1) take that actual URL it extracts and

1257,Extracting Page Source Information If Present,"VERSION BUILD=8961227 RECORDER=FX
Windows 8.1 Firefox 44.0

Okay, please forgive me for what may end up being very novice questions. I am fairly new to trying to use iMacros. Added it to Chrome a couple years ago but never really tried using it. I just added it to Firefox and am trying to find out if it can even do what I want it to do.

I am trying to use iMacros to search the page HTML source for a specific string. If that string exists I would like for it to extract that string along with the following 60 characters and date and time to append it to a CSV file. The thing is, that string could appear in the source 1 time, 20 times or perhaps not at all. I would then want the macro to wait 10 minutes, refresh the page and do the search all over again. I am looking for what may be subtle differences in if the string is found or not. Though I can determine the differences by analyzing the CSV file later. 

I am successfully able to search the page source with the below code. I have been able to get it to display a popup when the string is found. The problem is that it times out when the string is not found and the loop ends. Also, it is only prompting that the string exists. It is not logging that the string exists in a file for later analysis. I am also only able to extract the exact string, not the following 60 characters. 
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=8961227 RECORDER=FX
TAB T=1
TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:SUBMIT FORM=NAME:SearchForm ATTR=*
TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:More<SP>Dates
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""(String_Text_To_Find)"" IGNORE_CASE=YES EXTRACT=$1
PROMPT {{!EXTRACT}}

I hope that I provided enough information for someone to be able to answer my question. I guess I want to know if this is even something that iMacros is capable of doing before I put a lot of time in to working through it to only find out it isn't possible. My knowledge of iMacros and the code is very rudimentary right now, but I hope to learn a lot here and reading any resources you could point me to.

2. If there is an email address under Contact details, place it in a second column next to the name. Otherwise skip to the next entry.
3. The position and order of these elements may change. Is there a way to tell iMacro to just grab the text after ""Person:"" and ""Contact details:"" ?

Here's what I have written so far:
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=8920312 RECORDER=FX
TAB T=1
TAG POS=5 TYPE=TD ATTR=DIR:ltr EXTRACT=TXT
SET !VAR1 EVAL(""var s=\""{{!EXTRACT}}\""; s.split(',')[0];"")

PROMPT {{email}}

SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=/Users/bob/Desktop FILE=test2.csv

TAG POS=1 TYPE=IMG ATTR=BORDER:0&&ALIGN:MIDDLE&&SRC:/images/s-next.gif&&ALT:Next


SET !VAR2 EVAL(""var randomNumber=Math.floor(Math.random()*7 + 1); randomNumber;"")
WAIT SECONDS={{!VAR2}}

The code does not work. Specifically, iMacro ignores the split function I set up and returns TypeError: ""EXTRACT"".match(...) is null, line 8 (Error code: -1001) for the second part of the code. 

How can I edit this code to accomplish the above goals?

1300,"Find the right Colum to Extract Data, on the 3rd tab opened","Hi everyone,
good morning,

My name is Bruno, I'm brazilian. Sorry by the English. I need to build a code of a extraction in the site http://consulta.plus (with login and password, I can pass if you ask),  but first I need to fill the number of CPF (individual registration) and find the data of the client I'm look for.

Second, the site presents a table to click in anyone data (image1), I click in the line of the table, and the site goes to the table I want do extract the colum of ""Vlr Dispon铆vel"" and below, ""Margem Livre"", right below ""Margem Livre"" (credit card) but I cant to find de right code to find the correct extraction on the table, in a correct column ""Vlr. Dispon铆vel""






I tried to do this code:

macro = ""URL GOTO=http://consulta.plus#!"" + vbNewLine
macro = macro + ""'Get the values"" + vbNewLine

'Verifing the extraction
macro = macro + ""TAG POS=1 TYPE=TH ATTR=TXT:Vlr Dispon铆vel"" + vbNewLine
macro = macro + ""TAG POS=R1 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:bdytxt&&TXT:*.* EXTRACT=TXT "" + vbNewLine

Summing up, I need a code that extract the colum ""Vlr Dispon铆vel"" and down, ""Margem Livre"" and ""Margem Livre"" right below, and make a seach by CPF but when the site find the data of CPF he opens 3 tabs (image2_extract),

1301,"Different behaviour - scripting vs manual, with AJAX request","Hi all

Our ISP provides an online web site, where you can download a CSV of usage data.
I am attempting to write a tool that extracts this data for each of our customers only a regular basis, and injects it into a database so they can easily retrieve a graphical representation

There are two views of data - summary and detailed.
When I login to the website manually, the process is URL for login screen -> TAG enter details -> click A 'Detailed' -> click A 'Download Usage' -> click BTN 'Download'
The CSV that downloads shows detailed usage data.

I have built this behaviour into iMacros, using recording and some manual adjustments for additional waiting.
But the downloaded CSV is always only the 'summary' data - not the detailed.

I have confirmed by watching the script that iMacros does trigger the click on the A tag 'Detailed', which in theory is what 'switches' the behaviour of the Download button to download detailed data.
But the downloaded CSV is only ever summary view. I can even perform the same behaviour side-by-side, in a Chrome window manually on the right and iMacros 12 built-in browser on the left, and the output from iMacros is summary whereas the output from Chrome is detailed. Interestingly though - when I navigate the page using the iMacros built-in browser manually, it correctly registers that I've clicked on 'Detailed' view and downloads the full detailed CSV.

The website is very AJAX-heavy, to load in controls and data (hence having to build in plenty of additional WAIT commands). 
My thinking is that the built-in iMacros browser is not handling some form of local cache/cookie/session storage command from the website, whereas Chrome et al does.
As an example, in the Chrome developer when switching back forth between 'summary' and 'detailed' view (before downloading the CSV) this error is logged;
VM127:3 [Deprecation] 'window.webkitStorageInfo' is deprecated. Please use 'navigator.webkitTemporaryStorage' or 'navigator.webkitPersistentStorage' instead.

If I'm right, and the website is storing the 'current' view (detailed) in some kind of local storage, is there any way to replicate this behaviour in iMacros?

I've checked the 'Application' tab in Chrome developer console, and can't see any obvious setting stored in Local Session Storage or Cookies, just a SESSION_ID which doesn't help.
I've also tried to run my iMacros script in the main 3 browsers;
- IE 11 worked to load the web page, but no fields were ever filled in on the login page
- Chrome & Firefox were completely unresponsive when I click 'Play in -> ...' in the Script Editor

Only the built-in iMacros browser works, and it comes very close to what's needed by just refuses to 'remember' that it's clicked 'Detailed View' before it downloads
Note that I've tried clicking both the 'Detailed' and 'Download' buttons as both TAGs and EVENTs

I'm using iMacros 12 on Windows 10
If anyone has any suggestions relating to tricks for handling AJAX-heavy pages, ideas about how to force iMacros to 'fully register' a click on an AJAX page, or tips for getting iMacros to work with Chrome on Windows 10 I'd appreciate it

Sam",https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=27904&sid=8ea127909c0d83c2fac4f53ec6c3d19a,fill

Mine was to split the text from the clipboard to lines and put every line, that starts with ""a)"" or ""A)"" into answer 1 and so on, and leaving the rest for the question.
But as I said, I have no clue how to do it, so maybe someone can help me?

I hope I made clear what i need.

Thank you in advance
