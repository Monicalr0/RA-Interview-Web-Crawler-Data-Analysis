*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

Thank you for helping us to help you better!",1
trim() not working,"FCI: (Added by Mod from User's Sig.)
My Config: iMacros Browser 11.5 DESKTOP; Windows 7

>>>

I'm extracting data that contains spaces, and so I use the trim() function to removes the spaces.

But It doesn't work!

Here's a sample code :
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=11.5.499.3066
TAB T=1
TAB CLOSEALLOTHERS

SET !VAR0 <SP><SP><SP><SP><SP><SP>Hi<SP>
SET someVar EVAL(""var some='{{!VAR0}}'.trim(); some;"")
PROMPT {{someVar}}

The code above should work normally but it returns this error :
Error -1250: JScript statement in EVAL contains the following error: Objects of type 'System.String' do not have such a member. Line 6: SET someVar EVAL(""var some='{{!VAR0}}'.trim(); some;"")

JavaScript does have trim() function and it works on IE and all browsers!

UPDATE : Apparently It works on FireFox Add-on but not on the iMacros Desktop Browser. Why doesn't it work on the iMacros Browser, which is supposed to be superior than the free add-ons ?!!",3

Hi Blakero,

Support for the trim() function is dependent on the version of the Javascript engine in use. It looks like you recorded your macro with an older version of the iMacros browser, and hence trim() is not available. However, you can use the replace() function with a regular expression to achieve the same result. An example is provided under the Manipulate extraction section on the EVAL command reference page.",1
How to extract data from CTRL+C,"Hi, I'm new to iMacros. I'm using iMacros VERSION BUILD=1011 Personal edition on Chrome 108.0.5359.125 64bit on Windows 10 Pro

Dynamic Frame Tracking,"Configuration: Surface Pro 2, Win 10, Firefox 53, iMacros Standard Edition (x86) Version 11.0.246.4051
Hi,
 I extract data from a web page and in the last few months the frame number (no frame names that refer to table) seems to vary from numbers 14-18 every few days/weeks.  My work around now is to manually change number.  I would like to able to have macro handle that, but I can't figure out how to do it. The original macro has 300 lines of code and I need to access this particular frame twice, line 47 and then again at line 234.  Ideally the macro would determine frame number, then store in variable for second access.  I have searched the web and I know there are scripting solutions out there but I am confused/unsure how to specifically code and then incorporate script into the existing macro: ie: Run firstpart.iim, run framenumber.js, then run finalpart.iim??
Thanks

Multiple HREF,"VERSION BUILD=1011 TRIAL VERSION

Hello, I've been exploring into multiple possibilities in iMacros, and I'm pretty impressed with how much time it has saved me. I'm now working on a new script that would extract numerous HREF, open them in new tabs, and then shut them. The issue is that the first HREF only worked, and the subsequent HREF didn't function at all. Can more than one HREF be extracted using a single script, like !VAR1, !VAR2? The sample script I'm using is shown below.
Code: Select allTAG POS=2 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=TXT:Visit

Write YES or No in CVS if script runs properly,"VERSION BUILD=1011 TRIAL VERSION

I've been using this platform for more than a week and have already created some fantastic scripts that make my job much easier. iMacros runs flawlessly, but the website we work on occasionally doesn't, thus I'm wondering if there's a method we can export if the loop was correctly completed or not and then export it to CSV or Directly to Excel so when loop is finished then we can check which Loop number we should do manual because it was not executed properly.

I'll use the same script I did in my most recent post. viewtopic.php?f=7&p=89250#p89250

To help you understand what I'm trying to accomplish, I've attached the screenshot below. It indicates that if lines 2 and 7 were properly run, the spreadsheet's row labeled ""LOOP 1"" should display ""YES,"" and if not, ""NO."" By this, after the loop was done we can see which one should we check back again and do manually the work instead of checking then one by one on the website and check if it done properly.",1
How to use iMacros to add HTML tag values in new line or Edit existing tag,"Google Chrome: Version 105.0.5195.102 (Official Build) (64-bit)
iMacros: 2021
System: Windows 10 Pro 21H2 19044.1949

There's a dropdown selection box with multiple preset tag values for user selection. However, I need a tag value with my own range value=""30.0 To 70.0"">30.0 To 70.0 which is not available.

How can I add a new tag value (new line) OR edit the existing to modify my required range by using iMacros Browser.

I've read a few similar post & solutions by Guru Shugar but those are for adding ""value"" into an empty field and another is to remove attribute ""disabled"" which is not what i required.

Any help will be much appreciated. Thanks.

How to extract dynamic table rows with loop & stop when reach a specific condition,"Google Chrome: Version 105.0.5195.102 (Official Build) (64-bit)
iMacros: 2021 
System: Windows 10 Pro 21H2 19044.1949

With Guru chivracq kind guidance from my earlier post viewtopic.php?f=7&t=32028, i'm able to extract required data with unique element style=""background-color: orange;"" by using 'Double Relative Positioning' instead of using Xpath.

Since the data table is dynamic with 15mins refresh interval, the total of rows will change from each refresh. I've tried to search for solution & study eval() from the forum posts (especially Guru chivracq solutions) but i'm still not able to grasp the technic somehow   

Here again, I hope to have more guidance to find the solution. 

Questions:-
1. Is there a way to make a loop instead of the way i'm using as per code below eg. 'Extract 1st rows, 'Extract 2nd rows and so on?
2. The extraction should be stopped when reached <tr class=""montage_atm_bottom even"", how can i achieve this?

My current code:-
Code: Select allSET !EXTRACT NULL
TAG POS=1 TYPE=TD ATTR=STYLE:""background-color: orange;""
TAG POS=R-1 TYPE=* ATTR=* 


'Extract 1st rows

Xpath code to extract specific element in nested TR and TD,"Good day everyone. I need guidance to extract a dynamic data from a table with multi-tier nested TR and TD which can be found in tbody section.

Fortunately, my required data can be identified with a unique element style=""background-color: orange;""

1. TAG XPATH=""//*[@id=""opt_montage_table""]/tbody//tr//td[@class='<SP>descriptorcell':[@style='background-color:<SP>orange;]'/div/span/a""] EXTRACT=TXT

Download a list of png with a loop,"Hi, I'm a beginner with iMacros and I want to download a list of png with a loop, here is my code :
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=8970419 RECORDER=FX

TAG POS=1 TYPE=IMG ATTR=SRC:https://www.doc-solus.fr/lib/images/icones/fleches/fleche.droite.3d.bleu.h100px.jpg


The problem is that at each loop the png gets replaced by a different png with the same name.

So I would want to rename at each loop the png (like CCPINFO2021-0, CCPINFO2021-1, CCPINFO2021-2, ...)

If you have any idea ? Thank you in advance.",2

"I need to keep this site ""Open"" all time, please help!","Good day!

I'm working as a Manager in a restaurant. We need to monitor the availability of the restaurant to the customers since some of our employees, are turning it off or making it ""Busy"", even if we don't really have customers. So long story short, Google led me to iMacros, the problem is, my macro is missing something. It can ""Open"" our restaurant, the script is working, but I need it to just ignore if we're already ""Open"", so do not do something else, just ""Open"" if we are ""Busy"". The error is displayed like this:

RuntimeError: element SPAN specified by TXT:reopen was not found, line: 4

I want it to run indefinitely, so when someone sets our restaurant to ""Busy"", the macro will just press ""Reopen"" itself.

Here's what is inside my macro:

Scraping text/links from specific web page <div> section to clipboard?,"[EDITED after feedback - sorry for the long post, trying to input all relevant information...]

I've been working on a project for a couple of years (it's a continual thing, so it's never-ending).
I've progressed to a point of using mouse/keyboard macros to scrape a list of text/links from a set of variable-length pages, to paste into Excel; then run an Excel macro to manipulate that data; then return to the webpage, close it & repeat on the next one (I have some error-checking in place in case of a failure).
I do this every 6 months or so.

I am scraping about *75,000 cemetery index pages on http://www.billiongraves.com, copying the names/dates/links of the people interred there, then sorting, filtering and eventually editing errors & merging duplicate records.
*FYI - there are about 600,000 cemetery pages, but I do some data preparation first, extracting only the 75,000 pages with data on them.

Recently, because of some minor site changes and Firefox add-in customizations, the macros that I painstakingly created over time (to pixel-perfect page coordinates, with JitBit Macro Recorder) need to be shifted & changed, which will take me a week or more to do.  It's painful...

I'm thinking of iMacros as an alternative (or as an additional part of the process), as I would LIKE TO do the following, but am not sure it's capable of this.
A typical page has a particular <div><id> section which shows the data I want - it would be ideal if I could select JUST that <div> section and copy all of its contents at once, to the clipboard, which I can then paste into Excel.
*right now, my macro is scrolling & selecting specifically-positioned lines depending on the length of the list...

So I'm looking for this very basic need first, as I can build up more functionality around it later as I learn more about iMacros.

EXAMPLE PAGE: https://billiongraves.com/site-map?ceme ... 295&page=0 - in the Page Source is the section:
Code: Select all	<div id=""content"">
        <h1 style=""margin: 10px 0 25px 10px;"">BillionGraves Site Map</h1>
        <div class=""card"">
            <h1 style=""float:left; margin: 10px 0 10px 10px;"">Burial records in <a href='/cemetery/Bethesda-Cemetery/100295' >Bethesda Cemetery</a></h1>
            <br class=""clearfloat"" />
            <div style=""border-bottom:#CCC thin solid; width:916px;""> </div>

            <div class=""center"">
*******HERE IS THE DIV ID SECTION 'MULTIPLE' WHICH CONTAINS THE DATA I WANT TO COPY*******                <div id=""multiple"">
                    <div class='backlinks'><a href='/site-map'>Sitemap</a> > <a href='/site-map?country=United+States'>United States</a> > <a href='/site-map?country=United+States&state=Tennessee'>Tennessee</a> > <a href='/cemetery/Bethesda-Cemetery/100295'>Bethesda Cemetery</a></div><div><div class='record'><a href='/grave/William-R-Brooks/31780628' alt='Brooks, William R.

            </div>
        </div>


My hope is that in selecting 'the entire block' - i.e. the whole <div> section - I can copy all the contents in one shot, rather than having macros scroll to the bottom to capture all the lines, which is not yet working 100% perfectly.

Is iMacros able to select a specific page section (edit: I have found that it can) and copy the hyperlink contents to clipboard or a file?  I see that it can extract content to a CSV file, for example (edit: in the paid version, not the freeware one).  This could work for me (if it creates a 2-column file, with the TEXT and also the LINK - really NEED both!), as I could later combine the CSVs and import to Excel in bulk.
*If the functionality is there to quickly/easily copy a defined <div> section, I'm happy to pay the $99 for the basic version to allow me to SAVEAS a file...

Any help or direction appreciated.

I'd like to my post with an apology, the last time I asked for support I simply gave up but didn't post to say thank you. 

I have been furthering my knowledge of iMacro and it's potential functions playing an online text based games. I'm trying to automate the purchase of a product. I think I've tried a variety of different methods and solutions between extracting css selectors, using the clipboard function and caused myself to become more confused.

The comment out is for my reference 

The extract function works but I would like some assistance in getting a specific piece of information out of it. 
It returns the following -
This foodhall is owned by Harry's Uncle!
And being held by Harry!
It currently has 220 hams.
The bullet price is $1,000 for each ham!

I would like to extract the 220 in this case (the number changes over time) and paste it into a box below it and submit the form. 

I can provide the html where this information is found if required.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. The forum, program and extensions are fantastic products, I will be purchasing a full license in the near future!",4
Extracting from Salesforce webpage,"FCI: Win 7 x32 + FF 49.0.2 (always the latest) + iMacro for FF 9.0.3 (always the latest)

Here is a snippet of the code from the page that I'm trying to extract data from. ""Member Banks need to journal"" is the text I'm trying to extract. The website is internal to my work domain so a link is not going to be helpful.

Here is some sample code that I've been playing with but can't seem to work it out.
I've tried inputting all manner of values for CLASS: [with is not present in the code] and for TYPE.

My hope is that once I see how it is done for this value I'll be able to build a iMarco that will Extract all the values I need into a CSV file. I'll also want to extract efhpCenterValue, efhpCenterLabel, and efhpCenterValue, etc.  Those are within a TD and SPAN so I'm not sure if they are handled differently. XPATH may be the way to go, but I'm not sure how to get the XPATH values.

Check if a CSS Selector exists on a webpage,"Hi all,
Preface:
-	I閳ユ獡 a beginner at coding, so your patience is appreciated   
-	Apologies if this isn閳ユ獩 the right forum group in which to post this question. I wasn閳ユ獩 quite sure where to put it.
-	I閳ユ獫e been looking for the answer to this question for several hours last night and this morning and couldn閳ユ獩 find it. If this type of question is already answered, I apologize for creating a redundant thread and would appreciate the link.
-	I tried very hard to include all the information required, as mentioned in the 閳ユ阀lease read this before reporting problems閳?thread. Please go easy on me if I neglected to include some important information. I閳ユ獟l happily provide anything else that閳ユ獨 needed.

iMacros v10.1.0 for FF, 'Free', FF94 (v94.0.1 (64-bit)), Win10_ENG.

I want my script to be able to check to see if there閳ユ獨 a specific CSS Selector on a webpage. If it doesn閳ユ獩 exist, I want the script to continue. If it does exist, I want the script to extract the HREF/URL link from the selector, open up a new tab, go to the URL extracted from the selector, and then close the tab and return to the first tab.

The CSS selector in question is:
Code: Select allbody > div:nth-child(15) > a:nth-child(1)

I wrote this code out:
Code: Select allSET !ERRORIGNORE YES
SET !TIMEOUT_STEP 1
TAG SELECTOR=""body > div:nth-child(15) > a:nth-child(1)"" EXTRACT=HREF
TAB OPEN
TAB T=2
URL GOTO={{!EXTRACT}}
WAIT SECONDS=1
TAB CLOSE
SET !EXTRACT NULL
TAB T=1

The problem with this code is that if the selector doesn閳ユ獩 exist, the script will open a new tab and then freeze (even though I have SET !ERRORIGNORE YES), presumably because it doesn閳ユ獩 know what to do with !EXTRACT, which is NULL. This is why I need the script to be able to check if the selector is on the page (unless there's another solution of which I'm not aware).

Additionally, I閳ユ獡 running the free version of iMacros, which only allows for three custom variables. I閳ユ獡 already using three variables to generate a random number earlier in the script:
Code: Select allSET !VAR1 1
SET !VAR2 3
SET !VAR3 EVAL(""var randomNumber=Math.floor(Math.random()*\""{{!VAR2}}\"" +\""{{!VAR1}}\""); randomNumber;"")

Is it possible to perform the check for the CSS selector without using any variables? If not, is it possible to generate a random number without the three variables so I can then use them for the check?

Thank you for reading and for your help.  ",5

[SOLVED]: Variables in TAG command are not resolved,"Hello everybody,

we need to mark certain values in a checkbox list.

If I record a macro it is giving me lines like
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=HREF:https://www.biconeo-aquascaping.de/mod/shop_admin/?sh_fn=article_edit&sub_fn=set_art_cat&cat_id=36&art_id=2323
TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=HREF:https://www.biconeo-aquascaping.de/mod/shop_admin/?sh_fn=article_edit&sub_fn=set_art_cat&cat_id=39&art_id=2323 
-> This example adds the categories 36 and 39 to the article 2323

We have the article Ids and the category Ids available, so I put them in a CSV file. Connecting to the CSV works, I get different values from the CSV in my script nicely. 

The problem comes with line:
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=HREF:https://www.biconeo-aquascaping.de/mod/shop_admin/?sh_fn=article_edit&sub_fn=set_art_cat&cat_id={{!COL4}}&art_id={!COL5}}
This leads to the error ""Element not found"" where you can see that iMacro doesn't resolve the CSV columns to the desired values. 

I tried 
Code: Select allSET myString https://www.biconeo-aquascaping.de/mod/shop_admin/?sh_fn=article_edit&sub_fn=set_art_cat&cat_id={{!COL4}}&art_id={!COL5}}
TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=HREF:{{myString}} 
This comes to ""Error: ""-1300: ElementNotFound"" at line 28    TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=HREF:{{myString}} Could not find element"", in other words, again the variable is not resolved. 

Can anybody help?

All the best
Casi

Yeah...!, this one approved but the Quality is still as Low as your first 2 Duplicates that I previously disapproved with:
2 Threads disapproved, User Notified, Reason(s):
- 2 Duplicates.
- Thread Title not compliant with Forum Rules.
- User didn't read the Forum Rules...

@User, I was going to approve your 1st Thread and would have asked you to read the Forum Rules to then accordingly improve its ""Quality"", but as you go ""spamming"" the Forum directly without waiting for Approval, I prefer to disapprove them both, ... to give you ""the time"" to read the Forum Rules...

+ Correct Sub-Forum to recreate your Thread would also rather be the 'Data-Extraction' Sub-Forum...


=> But you still reopened your Thread in the 'General' Sub-Forum while I asked you to reopen it in the 'Data-Extraction' Sub-Forum, ah-ah...!    
But OK, no big deal about that part, I will move your Thread myself to the correct Sub-Forum...   
(EDIT: Done, => Thread moved to the 'Data-Extraction' Sub-Forum.)

=> You still didn't read the Forum Rules, which leads to:   
- Thread Title not compliant with the Forum Rules (again!) => Not DESCRIPTIVE, sorry but ""Need help with my Project"" + ""How i resolve this?"" are 2 completely useless Thread Titles for a Tech Forum...

Important Progress iMacros Product Update,"Dear iMacros Customers and Users, 

We are writing to inform you that Progress will be officially discontinuing the Progress iMacros product, with a planned End-Of-Life date of November 30, 2023. 

What does this mean? 
Moving forward, Progress will continue to support the iMacros product and will only provide critical fixes as needed until the EOL date. We will honor all service agreements through the existing term, except for those contracts that go beyond the EOL date. Customers with service agreements that go beyond the EOL date will be contacted separately to discuss their options and next steps. We will continue to offer service agreement renewals that do not exceed the EOL date. 

What are your next steps? 
Please remain on the lookout for more communications from Progress in the coming months, as more information will be made readily available to assist you as you prepare your transition plans. 

If you have additional questions, please email iMacrosInquiries@progress.com 

On behalf of Progress, thank you for your continued partnership and commitment. 

Sincerely,  
The Progress iMacros Team",2
*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

How can I save all href values from list items to a text file with iMacros?

I am a newbie to imacros but have version 12.0.501.6698 installed on the PC.

I am trying to extract from the html of a page all the href values located in multiple list items. Then save those URLs into a text file.

The number of list items can be different so I cannot use a loop of a known number of iterations; I have to grab all the list items and extract the href attribute values.

Example of the format of the html code
Code: Select all<ul class=""bullet-list columns-2 columns--regular"">
<li><a href=""/search/agents/results.htm?location=ampthill"" >Estate Agents in Ampthill</a></li>
<li><a href=""/search/agents/results.htm?location=barton_le_clay"" >Estate Agents in Barton-Le-Clay</a></li>
<li><a href=""/search/agents/results.htm?location=bedford"" >Estate Agents in Bedford</a></li>
<li><a href=""/search/agents/results.htm?location=biggleswade"" >Estate Agents in Biggleswade</a></li>
<li><a href=""/search/agents/results.htm?location=bromham"" >Estate Agents in Bromham</a></li>
<li><a href=""/search/agents/results.htm?location=clapham_beds"" >Estate Agents in Clapham</a></li>
</ul>

I have looked at the code in similar articles such as - iMacros: Extract ID attribute from a ul li list

This is the code I have tried in imacros.
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=12.0.501.6698
TAB T=1
SET !ERRORIGNORE YES
SET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO
TAB CLOSEALLOTHERS
'SET !PLAYBACKDELAY 0.00

TAG POS=1 TYPE=UL ATTR=ID:bullet-list EXTRACT=LI
TAG POS=R{{!LOOP}} TYPE=A ATTR=ID:* EXTRACT=HREF
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=* FILE=c:\Development\towns.txt

I get an error Box

enter image description here

I have also tried modifying all the permutations for the Values of TYPE and what to EXTRACT.

The text file that should store the URLs from the href attributes in this line:

<li><a href=""/search/agents/results.htm?location=clapham_beds"" >Estate Agents in Clapham</a></li>

just contains a line #EANF# not ""/search/agents/results.htm?location=clapham_beds""

Problem with selecting a checkbox next to target text (text has no HTML tags),"Good evening everyone!

I can't solve a problem with iMacros and it is really bugging me, so I would really appreciate if someone could help me. I hope I've opened the topic on the correct board; otherwise, please forgive me, for this is my first post.
I spent hours and hours going through the wiki and this forum, but I cannot reach my goal of selecting checkboxes with the target text next to them on a specific website. So I'm starting to wonder if it's the problem of the HTML code, or if I'm doing something entirely wrong. I will describe the details below.

1. Config Info: 

iMacros for Firefox plugin 8.9.7, free (VERSION BUILD=8970419); browser: Pale Moon 28.9.3; OS: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit English

2. Target site code: 

The text content were replaced with general English terms because they were originally in Hungarian. (Also, ""etc etc"" was written by me in the STYLE section because it was a rather long style section with no real impact on my issue/macro itself.)  
Code: Select all<DIV id=""cuccLayer"" STYLE=""position:absolute; font-weight:bold; (etc etc...); "">
		 <center>Title1</center>
		 <hr>

<input type=""checkbox"" onClick=""cuccArray[0]=1-cuccArray[0];""> 410 pcs. ITEM1<br><input type=""checkbox"" onClick=""cuccArray[1]=1-cuccArray[1];""> 27 pcs. ITEM2<br><input type=""checkbox"" onClick=""cuccArray[2]=1-cuccArray[2];""> 9 pcs. ITEM3<br><input type=""checkbox"" onClick=""cuccArray[3]=1-cuccArray[3];""> 1 pc. ITEM4<br><input type=""checkbox"" onClick=""cuccArray[4]=1-cuccArray[4];""> 89 pcs. ITEM5<br><input type=""checkbox"" onClick=""cuccArray[5]=1-cuccArray[5];""> 23 pcs. ITEM6<br>
		 <hr>
		 <center>
		 <input type=""image"" src="".../SUBMIT.gif"" title=""SUBMIT"" onClick=""document.urlap.par1.value=cuccArrayToString(); document.urlap.Submit.value='svSelejtezes'; document.urlap.submit();"">
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		 <input type=""image"" src="".../sample2.gif"" width=""35"" height=""35"" title=""Title2"" onClick=""cuccHide(); return false;"">
		 </center>
</DIV>

3. Problem: 

I'm trying to write a macro that will look for specific text(s) on a site and then select the checkbox on the left side of it. For example, let's say I want to select the checkboxes to the left of the texts ""pcs.<SP>ITEM3"", ""pcs.<SP>ITEM4"" and ""pcs.<SP>ITEM5"". 

However, the checkboxes and the text are in a shared DIV container called ""cuccLayer"" and the texts don't have their own HTML tags and because of that, I fail to use relative positioning, even though I went over a lot of chivracq's posts dealing with the topic. I simply cannot come up with a solution, because all the macros I wrote (even after tweaking with POS=R1,R-1, etc) seem to handle all the text as a whole (verified by extraction in test mode) and I cannot position the checkboxes. My last idea before giving up and posting here was using relative positioning with the <br>tag, with no success (maybe TAG cannot be used with empty tags lacking an end tag, or simply <br> is not recognized?) 

The position/order of the checkboxes + texts are not static but PHP/JS-related, so the checkbox must be selected based on the current text following it (for more info, see: end of section 4).

4. Context, additional info about the target site and my macro: 

A sudden wave of nostalgia hit me, and I started to play again with a 19 year old Hungarian browser-based online RPG which I really enjoyed as a teen. Currently, I'm progressing with the quests. However, because only a few die-hard fans play the game anymore, making money is quite difficult because of a lack of ingame economy, so the only solution left is ""farming"" gold (meaning doing repetitive tasks to get items that I can sell in the game's own shop itself so I can generate gold without the need to trade with other players on the ingame marketplace).

I already succesfully wrote several ""farming"" macros that combine both JavaScript and iMacros (this is the main reason I'm using an older build with Pale Moon, due to the need for JS support). This means that the macro automates an ingame activity called mining, and my player character automatically mines ores with various value to sell. However, after a while, my inventory overflows with heavy and cheap ores, taking up much space from the ligher and more expensive ones, such as diamonds etc. When this occurs, a new interface comes in, telling me that I'm carrying too much stuff and I need to throw away something (this currently requires manual intervention on my part, meaning my macro is not fully automated). My target code provided in section 2 is this problematic interface which lists all the amount (""x pcs.""), and items (""ITEM3, ITEM4 and ITEM5"") in my bag and ask me to select with the checkbox what I want to throw away with a submit form. ""ITEM3, ITEM4 and ITEM5"" are the heavy and cheap stuff I want to automatically dispose of, so my macro can run in a loop and keep only the expensive items.

Also, because this is a PHP/JS-based online game, the array of items in my inventory are generated by the game and therefore dynamic, so I guess the onClick=""cuccArray[x]=1-cuccArray[x]; attribute of the checkbox I want to select cannot really be predicted/automated, because if the items in my inventory change, the array can be numbered completely differently.

5. Closing thoughts

I deliberately chose not to include any of my macros I experimented with, because I tried so many combinations that I wouldn't even know which one to write here. So if this seems as lazy to anyone, please forgive me. Thank you for everyone who went through my post, I would really appreciate some help. Even if my goal cannot be achieved because of the HTML structure, I would like to know it, because otherwise I will keep trying and failing. It might have started out as silly nostalgia but now the idea of me not being to solve the macro is bugging me even more than my love for that old browser RPG. I also really hope that the solution is not something really easy because I would feel very dumb (as I've mentioned, I've already succesfully did scripts and macros for other parts of this game, so I can use iMacros on at least a basic level).",7

How to extract nested informations using XPATH?,"iMacros ver: 10.0.2.1450 (FREE), Firefox, Windows 10

Hello,
The objective is to extract the value of HTML DOM Property such as id,href and data-download-file-url for each of the images displayed from this [website][https://www.freepik.com/search?dates=an ... rt=popular]. I believe XPATH will be suitable for this task as each of the image can be accessed by the following generalise XPATH Code: Select all/html/body/main/section[2]/div/div/figure[X]/div

with the capital X indicate the Image label that take the value from 1 to 50, for the aforementioned website.

I know that, to extract the properties of Figure 1, for example, can be achieved by
Code: Select allTAG XPATH=""/html/body/main/section[2]/div/div/figure[1]""  EXTRACT=TXT

However, the line above outputted all DOM Property including the one that I am not interested with.

According to the tutorial  below;

[OP1][https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?t=26155]
[OP2][https://stackoverflow.com/questions/385 ... cros-xpath]

Extracting specific DOM property can be achieved by something like the following
Code: Select allTAG XPATH=""/html/body/main/section[2]/div/div/figure[1]/div[@id='showcase__content'] ""  EXTRACT=TXT

However, the execution instead give an error.

I really appreciate if someone can shed some light about this problem.",13

"How to grab variable in source code to extract? (script type=""text/javascript""> var abc = <payload>)","Hi there,

first off, let me include some information:
VERSION BUILD=12.6.505.4525, Trial Version on Windows 10 64-bit, English with Browser IE11. Demo scripts and another script that I built today work well.

I am trying to build a macro that will run through a series of weekends for a car rental company and will store the advertised price in a csv file. I will then later be able to look at the data, mark which weekends I find interesting and - that will be a future project - use a second macro to book those weekends.

The company's website is nice enough to include all the data I really want in one ""object"" up top. ""Object"", because here is where it gets tricky for me: I don't know how to call that, let alone grab it. It is not something that drives the display on the website, and I can't seem to use the right ""find"" option for the TAG command - however I wonder whether it would not be much more elegant go via xpath, if that is possible here.

How would I go about 
1) for beginners, and to understand how this works, grabbing everything inside the variable sxux?
2) to really get what I need, grabbing the part marked in green, i.e. the entire string in quotation marks right after ""prc_wc"" (our, put differently everything between prc_wc and prc_pp)?

What i am trying to reach is get the price of an item in step one and add  +5% via the EVAL command to the price before i paste it into another field.
However something seems to be wrong with my code. It just extracts the price and does not modify nor paste it into the field. I made sure it only extracts numbers (Format: XX,XXX) and nothing else.
Any idea on this?

In another step i would also like to divide the price through a fixed number. Example would be to calculate how many items i can purchase for a fixed amount i have in my wallet. Would this worK?

Trying to redo loop if EANF,"Hi guys, first post,  trying to self teach iim and its going pretty well but i need to redo some of my web scraping and im a bit stumped.   Heres the raw code,  I use it to enter 2 variables and then press go and i want to scrape the output  The issue is My internet is rotating Ip every so often and if it times up just right when it rotates then the output is EANF,  for some reason if i get too many of those then iim just locks up and it doesn't work anymore,  I like to set this up to run all night and set it to run slow so it never messes up.  I think what i need to do though is something along the lines of

If Extract = #EANF# then redo this loop using same variables

SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=C:\Users\hirea\Downloads FILE=Output.csv

p.s. The website where I would actually like to replace the text is much more complicated. I will create a dummy account and provide login credentials if someone is willing to help. Maybe start with the simpler example above though..?

All demo macros work fine


I have tried relentlessly over the past week to adjust my script so it only scrapes followers that themselves have at least a certain amount of followers. One of my accounts get spammed persistent and I simply need to filter out the noise from real meaningful followers

The following script does in fact work quite well down only to one problem, the loop. It runs fine all the way to the extract tag position and than instead of grabbing the actual tag of the current loop it somehow takes the next one instead. I even utilized the great idea about the loop-switch posted in the forum to jump out if a condition is not met

What it currently does is to filter out all my followers that have themselves at least 400+ followers and writes it into the csv file. Perhaps CONTENT=MOUSEOVER is wrong but I am not sure.

PROBLEM 1: the first TAG POS is working correctly, however further down the TAG POS should still be in the same LOOP iteration but it is not, it is taking the next found TAG instead.

PROBLEM 2: SAVEAS EXTRACT does not write the extract each into a new line inside the csv file but simply all into one line.

I would greatly appreciate some help to hopefully get it solved as I am out of ideas on this one. Thank you

SOF: Extract Data using EVAL with Triple Separator.,"Some interesting Thread on SOF from 2 weeks ago, the User was ""supposed"" to open a parallel Thread on our Forum, but after asking several times and ""waiting"" with no Follow-up anymore since 10 days, I guess they probably managed to find a Solution, that they probably will never share, so I'm a bit ""tired"" of waiting and I'm creating this ""parallel"" Thread ""on their behalf""..., before they will eventually delete their Thread on SOF, which happens for more than 50% of Threads/Qt's related to iMacros on that Forum...

Customer reviews: 666 ratings

Question answered: 180 question was answered among 200

what I want

for customer review and question answered I want only first number: 666 & 180 not text or any other number

and for product title: The text part before first comma (,): PLUSINNO Telescopic Fishing Rod and Reel Combos Full Kit it can be either , or : or - so the product title will be cut off by first (, or : or -)

I know eval can help, but I can not implement.

Thank you.

And I would of course have been ""curious"" to hear how this User implemented the desired Functionality to extract this ""Product title"" Field until the first of the 3 possible Separators, a bit like the Functionality in 'Excel' when importing/opening a '.CSV' File, with 5 or 6 possible Separators that can be combined together...

I had several possible Solutions/Implementations in mind, but I think if I had had to implement that Functionality for myself, I would have gone for 'indexOf()' for the 3 Separators, + 'push()' to an Array with a Check on 'indexOf()'>=0 (Char/String not found returns ""-1""), and then with 'Math.min()' or 'sort()' on the Array to return the lowest 'indexOf()' Value (>0) to reuse with 'substr()' or 'substring()' on the original Extract...   

And hum, with ""only"" 3 Separators, it might actually be simpler and shorter to handle all the Conditions with just several 'if'/'else' Statements...  ",15

I am using above code to extract google search result as csv format. The code has no issue. Problem is after running the loops 7 times or generally 13 times or any random times captcha comes (I am not robot) and I need pause the loop to solve captcha manually. I am expecting to implement captcha solution in my code so each time captcha comes imacros solve it automatically and the the code runs without interrupt . As you can see I am using csv file as input to run google search which contain 2000+ rows so I can not sit and solve captcha manually.

I have search for solution in this forum and got info that may be I have to buy a captcha solution service but do not know how it will work with  my current iim file as the captcha comes suddenly rather than the site which contains a form with I am a robot captcha always there.

Thank You

Help needed with Keyword Assertion,"VERSION BUILD=10022823
iMacros 10 Browser
Windows 10

First of all, apologies for my naivety in this subject. I'm still pretty new to all this.
Basically I'm looking to write a code that goes to a user on a website, and if it finds the words 'Status: Online' it saves the username to an online.txt file, and if the username is offline it saves it to a offline.txt file, and then moves on to the next username, which would be given by {{!COL2}}.
Now I understand that the macro is searching for Status: Online or Status: Offline, but then the extract command is mutually exclusive regardless of whether or not it finds the text on the page anyway.
Thus when I run the script, it saves the username to both the Online file, and the Offline file.
Here's what I have so far:
Code: Select allSET !DATASOURCE filter.csv
SET !LOOP 1
SET !DATASOURCE_LINE {{!LOOP}}
FILTER TYPE=IMAGES STATUS=ON

URL GOTO=www.test.com/user={{!COL1}}
 
SEARCH SOURCE=TXT:""Status: Online""

Triggering macro to accept or reject jobs (text lines with links) when they appear,"VERSION BUILD=12.0.501.6698
Microsoft Windows 10
IE 11 or Firefox 74.0

Hello, I'm working in remote as a contractor for a customer who has CST, while I have Greenwich time (a little different actually, but it's not important). I would like to activate a macro able to accept or reject new jobs when they pop up on the customer's website while I'm sleeping. I've already recorded macros to accept or reject jobs when they appear. A new job displays as a simple line of text on top of the screen, then I can run a macro like:

TAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=ID:cphMain_gvwWorkOrderList_Label1_0
TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:SUBMIT FORM=ID:form1 ATTR=ID:cphMain_btnAccept (Firefox)

TAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=ID:cphMain_gvwWorkOrderList_Label1_0
TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:SUBMIT ATTR=NAME:ctl00$cphMain$btnAccept (IE)

What I need is something that triggers this only when a new job appears in the main window (accepted jobs remain there, only in a different color, like rows of a table, so they must not trigger the macro).",2

Important Progress iMacros Product Update,"Dear iMacros Customers and Users, 

We are writing to inform you that Progress will be officially discontinuing the Progress iMacros product, with a planned End-Of-Life date of November 30, 2023. 

What does this mean? 
Moving forward, Progress will continue to support the iMacros product and will only provide critical fixes as needed until the EOL date. We will honor all service agreements through the existing term, except for those contracts that go beyond the EOL date. Customers with service agreements that go beyond the EOL date will be contacted separately to discuss their options and next steps. We will continue to offer service agreement renewals that do not exceed the EOL date. 

What are your next steps? 
Please remain on the lookout for more communications from Progress in the coming months, as more information will be made readily available to assist you as you prepare your transition plans.

*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

imacros question
Posted by Focalav 绂?27/02/2020 - 18:46

HI all Im trying to do a data extract from a specific loaction, for a random bit of data using imacros.
Im trying to use a SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP query but the query structure is a mystery to me.
Ive read: http://wiki.imacros.net/SEARCH
but this doesn't explain enough so that I can figure out how to make it useful in building my own query.

A sample bit of the source webpage is:
Code: Select all<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=""220px""><div style=""width:200; height:25; background:url(/images/timedcombat-background.png); border:1px solid #000000;""></div></td><td>Next target: <b>6 seconds</b></i></td></tr></table>

So Ive tried: a whole bunch of stuff trying to figure out how the query structure works but I haven't go it.

Imacros Notes on using SEARCH REGEXP
Code: Select allSEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:..[^]"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: undefined
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:..[^s]"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: undefined
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:..[^0-9]"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: undefined
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:"".*target..([0-9]+)"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: Source Doesnt match target
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target..([0-9]+)"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: Source Doesnt match target
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:..([0-9]+)"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives:Source Doesnt match target
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:..([^0-9]+)"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives:Source Doesnt match target
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:..([^0-9])"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: b
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:.([^0-9])"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: <
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:([^0-9])"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: Blank, literaly, the space character I think..
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:?([^0-9])"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: ;
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:?.([^0-9])"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: <
SEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:?.([^0-9])"" EXTRACT=$1 | gives: Blank, literaly, the space character I think..
Code: Select allSEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:?.([^0-9]+)"" EXTRACT=$1
... =>  | gives: UGH,.. some part of the Imacros source code?
Code: Select allvar altKey;
var ctrlKey;
var metaKey;
if (window.event != null) {
c=String.fromCharCode(window.event.keyCode).toUpperCase();
altKey=window.event.altKey;
ctrlKey=window.event.ctrlKey;
metaKey=window.event.metaKey;
}else{
c=String.fromCharCode(e.charCode).toUpperCase();
altKey=e.altKey;
ctrlKey=e.ctrlKey;
metaKey=e.metaKey;
}
if (window.event != null)
target=window.event.srcElement;
else
target=e.originalTarget;
if (target.nodeName.toUpperCase()=='INPUT' || target.nodeName.toUpperCase()=='TEXTAREA' || altKey || ctrlKey || metaKey){
}else{
if (c == '

So Then I decided I need help. Yes, I'm on the imacros forums, but help there is hit and miss.
is there documentation of how exactly to form Search Source queries using imacros? Or does anyone use Imacros, and could explain this to me.

So, here it is...   
I won't ""try"" to answer it (even if there are some much easier/simpler Solutions) as the User didn't ""follow up"" on my Disapproval by reopening their Thread with some ""correct"" Quality, but I found the Research part with all different 'SEARCH' Statements and their Results quite interesting though   , and worth sharing on the Forum...   

And I've reformatted a bit the Post, especially about the very last 'SEARCH' Statement that I separated from the previous ones, which seems to retrieve some iMacros Core Code about the 'EVENT' Mode... Hum..., strange indeed...

@OP (= @Focalav), you are still ""welcome"" to post in this Thread if you ""notice"" it, you won't be able to take Ownership of this Thread, but if you post in it, you'll be able to get Notifications..., and I might still help you if you follow up ""a bit correctly"" and also mention your FCI like I already asked you...

How to extract certain links and assign them to an array variable?,"Hi. I am new to iMacros.

 I use Windows 10, iMacros 12.0.1.171 Enterprise trial version, chrome 78.0.x

 Any help will be greatly appreciated!

 I want to do something very simple but don't know how to do this.


 I want to extract all the links having a certain word in a web page.

 For example, I want to extract all the links having 'JCC' like below:

  1) http://JCC.domain-name.com/any_number_or_letter_or_whatever
  2) http://JCC.domain-name.com/any_number_or_letter_or_whatever
  3) http://JCC.domain-name.com/any_number_or_letter_or_whatever

  ... and so on

 After extracting all the links above, I want to move to each web page one by one or randomly.

 I mean, after visiting the first page, I want do something, and then, I want to move to the 2nd web page,  and then wait for 7 seconds, using 'WAIT SECONDS=7' command, to load the web page completely, and I want to do something... and so on.

I must not visit the web page I had already paid a visit.

 Q1) How can I assign each link having a certain word to an array? How can I assign all the links to an array AT RANDOM or FROM TOP-TO-BOTTOM OF THE HTML PAGE?

 Q2) How can I move to each web page using the array variable?

 Sometimes, the web page doesn't show all the links having 'JCC's, so I might have to hit the F5 key to refresh the web page.

 Sometimes I get no new link, sometimes 5 or 10 new links which were not displayed before reloading the web page. 

 There is no way to know how many times I have to reload the web page but I guess 2 to 5 would be good.

 Q3) I want to add all the new links from the reloaded the web page to the previous array. How can I do this?


[Q4] I might have to use this macro later again. Then, I must NOT revisit the web page I'd already visited. How can I make iMacros do this?

 Thank you very much in advance. : )",4
Issues with EXTRACT (Using Xero software),"1. What version of iMacros are you using?

Hi all,

Hoping you can help. VERY new to this iMacros so forgive my ignorance. I am trying to run a loop of updating bills on the Xero accounting software and have hit an issue with copy/paste text using EXTRACT function. My code (or portion of it ) is below;
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=ID:addNewLineItemButton
TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=ID:ext-gen60
TAG POS=1 TYPE=IMG ATTR=ID:ext-gen63

TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT

TAG POS=3 TYPE=DIV ATTR=TXT:1.00
TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=ID:frmMain ATTR=ID:ext-comp-1005 CONTENT={{!VAR2}}
SET !EXTRACT NULL#

I am having an issue specifially with the line
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT


When I prompt to see what !VAR2 is, the returned text string is almost like it has done a crtl-A of the whole webpage. Am I doing something obviously wrong? Does Xero have stange things imbedded into their text strings that is messing me around? 

In short, I am trying to copy one cell of data to another. It is always a number string. Never text.

Thanks for your help",10

iMacros 12 not recording keystrokes or extracting data,"I閳ユ獡 creating a Excel macro with iMacros and VBA.  I've done this before without too many issues on a number of web sites.  I started off using the iMacros browser.  I got about 1/2 way through entering data on the web page without any issues.  So far so good.

This particular web page has a number of sections, e.g., Summary Info, Claim Info, Parts, Operations, Expenses, Comments, and Customer (in this order).  When I got to the Parts, Operations, Expenses, Comments, and Customer sections, there is a toggle switch to hide / display the fields in that section.  The Parts, Operations, and Expenses sections all display a minus sign (to hide the fields) but no fields are displayed.  The Comments and Customer fields also display the minus sign but the fields in those sections are displayed.  I haven't seen anything like that before.

I then changed the code to use iMacros with the IE browser.  The good news is I can now see the missing fields in all of the sections now.  I kicked off the macro and it got part way through the existing code and then I had an issue where it didn't extract the header I was looking for.  I tried to use the sidebar but can閳ユ獩 use IMacros functionality, e.g., it won閳ユ獩 let me extract data and doesn閳ユ獩 record keystrokes like I normally can.  It's almost like it is frozen.

Extracting data with Chrome addon,"I'm trying to learn more about the Chrome addon in hopes that it may solve some issues I have with pop-ups.  I'm able to open iMacros in Chrome.

However, when I try to use the Chrome addon, I can record a macro and it works.  However, I don't see any buttons to extract data.  Am I missing something?  Is it right in front of me?

Also, macros seem to run slower with the Chrome addon than with IM or IE browser but that's a question for another day.  

Any help in extracting data would be appreciated.  If there is reference material that you can point me to that would be helpful.  I've tried the Wiki and haven't found what I'm looking for.  I'm not sure what the purpose of the Chrome addon is at this point.  Thanks for your help.

Extracting users in instagram (in the likes of the photo),"Hi everybody! i am new on imacros scripting and i am not a programmer. I know very little about programming and I only adapt the command lines and analyze how they work, so I am making the program work.

I managed to learn about imacros at this time but still I need to explain step by step all detailed how to run the following program.

I make a video explain the problem.
Please look at the cursor carefully and interpret how it works, it's simple

https://youtu.be/tMbF3CawzRU


My goal is as follows: Open the profile of a user, select a photo and enter the ""Like"", within the ""I like"" enter the profile of each person to extract the username ""URL"".

The problem is that my program only extracts 11 users (Those that appear as ""DIV"" in the instagram code).

I designed another program which appears at the beginning of the video to demonstrate how it extracts perfectly but this is ONLY for FOLLOWERS - FOLLOWED.
Analyze the instagram code and this code allows me to ""preload"" the number of people I need and this makes the program WORK. Unlike the previous one (within the ""LIKES"" IT DOES NOT ALLOW ME ""PRE LOAD"" USERS and this limits the program (LOOP = 12-15-20-30-etc. It stops working with error # EANF #).

First program ( VIDEO ) code: ""FOLLOWES AND FOLLOWED (ONLY) ""
Code: Select allSET !ERRORIGNORE YES

I don't think they need anything more than this.

Apparently the DIV structure does not allow pre-loading users and I don't know how to solve this in order to extract the number of users that I want

possible to scrape/save images using imacros and save to csv?,"Hi - is it possible for an imacros script to scrape/copy/save an image from a website and place it into a spreadsheet (xlsx or csv)? Ideally I want imacros to take the image from the site, then reduce the size so it fits into a column field in a spreadsheet. For instance if the website image is 10cm x 10cm large, reduce the size to 2cm x 2cm and insert into the spreadsheet. Is this possible and if so how? many thanks",10

I want first, to extract all these value(multiple outcome) into a .txt file

Then use SET !LOOP or VAR to these enter values into boxes on the same webpage.

I want to extract 19.93 from this line,

I use

I tried these and it doesn't work,
Code: Select allSEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""target:\=(\d+\.\d{1,2})""    EXTRACT=$1

Code: Select allSEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""1""    EXTRACT=$1
Code: Select allSEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""a""    EXTRACT=$1
Code: Select allSEARCH SOURCE=REGEXP:""*""    EXTRACT=$1 

Can anyone shed a light, is regexp no longer supported?

Anyway, I downgraded to 9.0.3.

I think I will also try another way, save the page source and use CMD to filter out the result.

2.  The first column has the data duplicated in the same column: ie ""ABC"" comes through as ""ABCABC"".  Again I could handle that in programming but I don't think I should have to.

How to use TAG SELECTOR for extracting a table,"Hi,
Using IMacros Personal Edition 12.5 with Firefox
I  have a little trouble with extracting data from a table. So I decided that I would try using a CSS selector (TAG SELECTOR=""""). But I cant find any examples of using TAG in this manner.

Code: Select allTAG SELECTOR="".darker-grey-header-background , .asc , .align-top , .navigateable , .align-center , .thick-top-header-border"" EXTRACT=TXT

I generated the CSS selector using a tool: SelectorGadget (Addon for Chrome). I assume that the CSS selector for FireFox would be the same as in Chrome.

My Question: Is this the correct way for using TAG SELECTOR?

iMacros for IE stops scraping data after 15-20 minutes while script runs,"I've been having an ongoing issue with iMacros for IE where, while running a script, the script will run fine for about 15-20 minutes (grabbing the data I need), but then stops grabbing the data and fills empty. I've tried time constraints to give the page enough time to upload, but this is not the issue.
I've isolated this problem to only IE, as it runs fine on Firefox (and even ran fine on the iMacros browser, which I no longer have). The only issue is, I need to run this script in IE (as it captures the data in such a way that makes it usable for me).

Is anyone else having this issue, and have they found a way around it?",1

"[Youtube]Subscribe, get video title and input it to a Spreadsheet","Hi guys

I have to do this following task

On behalf of Progress, thank you for your continued partnership and commitment. 

Sincerely,  
The Progress iMacros Team",2
*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

EXTRACT and ONDOWNLOAD,"Hello folks!
Windows 7, iMacros for Firefox 8.9.7, Firefox 54.0.1 (32-bit)

I'm an iMacros beginner and I need your help.

I want to extract description of a file and then present it in a message box, after the file is downloaded.
I used EXTRACT=TXT command, but because of this command, iMacro doesn't download the file anymore:
Code: Select allTAB T=1

I doubled the entry (one without that EXTRACT=TXT command) and now it works:
Code: Select allTAB T=1

It's just, I don't think it is supposed to look that way.
I'd like to write codes as good as possible.
Could you possibly tell me how my code should look like?

Plus, is it possible to present just a part of extracted text?
I mean in this case: instead of prompting whole ""Business Tendency Survey and Real Sector Confidence Index (July 2017)"" iMacro would prompt just ""(July 2017)"".",5

"Choose pdf name dynamically by variable does not work, datetime only","Dear friends, 

Imacros Version: 10.0.5
Chrome: Vers鑼玱 71.0.3578.98
OS: Windows 10 64 bits

I trying download some open pdf's in som sites, for example here I will put this site:
https://www.wdl.org/pt/item/18529/

So the title of this page is ""Val閿歯cia. Mercado"", I want extract the title of many pages to put in pdf name when downloaded. 

My script working with dynmi datetime:
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=H1 ATTR=ID:page-title EXTRACT=TXT
SET !VAR1 {{!EXTRACT}}
TAG SELECTOR=""#downloads>LI>A""
ONDOWNLOAD FOLDER=* FILE=+_{{!NOW:yyyymmdd_hhnnss}} WAIT=YES
TAG SELECTOR=""#downloads>LI>UL>LI:nth-of-type(2)>A""

So, when I download using this above code, the name of archive comes:  ""18529_20181223_223412"", this proof that the datetime dynamicaly works.

But when I try put the title page as filename dinamycaly (to work in another pages), dont work, see my script:

Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=H1 ATTR=ID:page-title EXTRACT=TXT
SET !VAR1 {{!EXTRACT}}
TAG SELECTOR=""#downloads>LI>A""
ONDOWNLOAD FOLDER=* FILE=+_{{!VAR1}} WAIT=YES
TAG SELECTOR=""#downloads>LI>UL>LI:nth-of-type(2)>A""


I thinks must be some simple action to solve this (because the dynamic datetime works, some the name by variable must work by logical thinking), I try many things and dont work, someone can help with this?

Questions on data valadation and extraction to CSV,"This has been written again as I was corrected for my previous attempt 
In the small amount code below I would like to do the following:

1. verify that the searched value appears on the page that was retrieved
     If so then proceed with text extraction
     If not then write a simple text string to a field in the excel file were data will be extracted to. EXAMPLE -  search value (col1) / not found (col2)
2. In the code below POS 7 and POS 8 are associated.  I would like to write them on the same row in excel. EXAMPLE - search  value (col1 row 1) POS7 (col 3 row 1) POS* ( col4 row 1)
3. After all data has been written for that search value, write the next search value data on a new row in the excel file
4. Loop through this until all items have been searched.

I hope this is more clear.

After that, i want it to go back to main page, go to the next line in the csv file (so second client) and input the second code. Keep doing this until the csv has no more lines.

Extracted Values Include Unwanted Labels,"Good Afternoon -

I continued to see what the output would be and once I ran the job, it created a CSV which included both the label and value.

An example website is below. If someone could get me started, I can easily adapt it for the other websites.  Thank you very much in advance for any help!

extracting data same web but different pages,"Dear all,
I am evaluating the iMacros product, in general I do find it as an useful tool and before to buy it I wanted to check how powerful tool it is and here is the point, since I am trying to scrap data from a web (made with wordpress) which has (apparently) tables in hundreds of pages which are similar but not the same. 

I am posting here an example of a command I did create in order to extract only a row which reports some data from one webpage: 

1- TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=VALIGN:top EXTRACT=TXT 
2- SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=* FILE=*
3- TAG POS=5 TYPE=TD ATTR=VALIGN:top EXTRACT=TXT
4- TAG POS=6 TYPE=TD ATTR=VALIGN:top EXTRACT=TXT
5- TAG POS=7 TYPE=TD ATTR=VALIGN:top EXTRACT=TXT
6- TAG POS=8 TYPE=TD ATTR=VALIGN:top EXTRACT=TXT
7- TAG POS=9 TYPE=TD ATTR=VALIGN:top EXTRACT=TXT
8- TAG POS=10 TYPE=TD ATTR=VALIGN:top EXTRACT=TXT


When I create a LOOP, the page 2 and following ones have same header (here as above at line 1) but different positions. It makes impossible to scrap hundreds of pages, because the output comes with a .csv file with an irregular structure, not possible to use for further job.

I might be wrong using the script but in your experience, is there any solution that would help me?
Hoping to have been clear in my explanation, otherwise please post me further questions, I'll be more than glad to reply you.

EXTRACT=CHECKED wont find check box,"Hey guys, need a little help here. 

Windows 10 Pro
iMacros Browser V12.0.501.6698
iMacros BUILD=12.0.501.6698

I have a check box and I am trying to select the check box if it is not selected.  

To start out I have seen this thread https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?t=27248
and I have the main concept down I just cannot get the EXTRACT to return a YES or NO.

Here is my code using regular record:
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=12.0.501.6698

'New tab opened
TAB T=2
TAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=ID:ctl00_cph_ctl02_MainLocTree_tree_SelAll_D  'This line selects check box


here is the line when I use the expert recorder:
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN FORM=NAME:aspnetForm ATTR=ID:ctl00_cph_ctl02_MainLocTree_tree_SelAll_D&&CLASS:dxWeb_edtCheckBoxUnchecked_1<SP>dxICheckBox_1 'Unchecked Box
TAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN FORM=NAME:aspnetForm ATTR=ID:ctl00_cph_ctl02_MainLocTree_tree_SelAll_D&&CLASS:dxWeb_edtCheckBoxChecked_1<SP>dxICheckBox_1 'Checked Box

So I either get two returns, the one below returns that EXTRACT=CHECKED only works on check boxes:
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN FORM=NAME:aspnetForm ATTR=ID:ctl00_cph_ctl02_MainLocTree_tree_SelAll_D EXTRACT=CHECKED

This line returned an error saying the extract value is #EANF#:
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=HIDDEN FORM=NAME:aspnetForm ATTR=ID:ctl00_cph_ctl02_MainLocTree_tree_SelAll_D EXTRACT=CHECKED

Additionally here is the HTML from the website that selects the checkbox (I think):
Code: Select all<input type=""hidden"" name=""ctl00$cph$ctl02$MainLocTree$tree$STATE"" id=""ctl00_cph_ctl02_MainLocTree_tree_STATE"" value=""Y2dkZ2ACYQYQUChyYGdkYmT7/5+dgZ2V/Q2Q5AIKs3MzsRoZWhgbQygTCGUKpIxMLMwglDmQMjE0AMlZWpiZQShzCGUBoiwNTSGUGdBUNiY2v/yUVE8XdiaegMSi1LwSGJfNvaggPsCbmYnNJz8ZzOAASYWkVpSwg8X8korY2RkA"">

Any advise on why it isn't finding the checkbox?

Can I extract the Data?,"I am unable to extract the data from this web site...

I don't know what technology they are using for the web page.  The HTML source for the page shows a single line including the text ""ngview"".   Looking up this on the internet it is a directive used by AngularJS but that could just be a coincidence and they could be doing something else.

Is there anyway to extract the data on this website with iMacros?",2
Crawling a site to make site map,"Hi,

There's an informative site that does not provide a site map and I want to make one for my own use in referring to the information it provides. I'm looking to see if I can accomplish this with iMacros. What I need to do is crawl the site and extract the text and URLs for internal links on all its pages, saving them in some sort of tree that indicates the hierarchy of the links. Also, the site does have section menus in the left margin, and I could construct a full site map by just extracting those and knitting them together.

Is it possible to do that with the FireFox add-on?

As a brute-force method, I could also do it if I can just crawl all the links to URLs within the site and download the HTML for all pages and use a text editor to manually extract link tags and then arrange those in the proper order. I could do that if I just have the ability to crawl the links and download the pages.

I looked through the iMacros Wiki page on ""Data Extraction"" and didn't see anything on how to crawl a site. I searched the Wiki for ""crawl"" and for ""site map"" and got no results. I looked through the forum on ""How-To's and Examples for Web Scraping"" and didn't see anything that seems applicable. And I did a search in this forum (Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping) for ""crawl"" and ""site map"" and found one thread (http://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=3291) that referred to the Wiki page on Web Scripting, which apparently requires the Enterprise edition, which I don't have, and which also does not say anything directly about crawling.

So, two bottom line questions:
* Can a site be crawled using a free version of iMacros? 
* Is there documentation somewhere specifically on how to use iMacros to crawl a site?

Thanks for your help.


The requested background info is:
1. What version of iMacros are you using? - iMacros for Firefox 8.8.2
2. What operating system are you using? - Windows 7 Pro 64-bit English
3. Which browser(s) are you using? - FireFox v 30.0",5

Variable reading and timeout loop,"Hi everyone! I'm just got iMacros cause I need it to create a bot for my economical simulator. In this game, you have to fight 10 times a day and work once to get paid.
If there are people who want to help, I would really appriciate it.
The theory it's simple, but I have no ideea how to write the code.

My plan is to write this bot that it can automatically fight 10 times, with a break of 10 minutes between each fight. I could do this by simply recording the macro, but there are some problems.
I can't beat someone who has more energy than me. So, I'm looking for a code that can read my victim's energy, and if the number is bigger than 5 (for example), than return and find another one who has less.
I've put here a printscreen that shows how this menu looks. The code should read vitim's energy from this menu, check if it is bigger than 5 and return to the list for searching another one with less energy. Or if it's possible to figure out from the begining the one that has less than 5% energy, why not.
I've thought that going by inspect element in chrome may help me. I located the line where energy is displayed, but I have no ideea how to write the code.

I've started building this code, but it can only do simple tasks cause I dont know how to improve it yet.

so I'm safe from getting banned, cause they could check that I'm doing my fights every day at the same interval. I will keep editing this timeout.
So, besides variable reading, I would also need a loop with an timeout of 10min between each task group.

I really want to learn some coding commands, as a begginer. If you guys can help me with that, I would really appriciate it.

As a summary, I need a code for reading variables who can chose the victim that has the energy under 5% and a loop one, with a timeout of 10mins between each fight, who would simplify that long code.
A tested fight, is defined by that:

Extract image path from table,"Specialty electrics draw eyes at July series CHICAGO -- Whether it was the free food or the products themselves, lots of the buyers in the NHMA Mid-Year Show here gravitated toward stalls with specialty kitchen electrics.

>> http://bitly.com/best-masticating-juicer
On display were an variety of appliances such as pastamakers, ice cream makers, breadmakers, cappuccino/espresso makers, juicers and waffle irons. While producers touted their goods, fresh bread, pasta, ice cream, cappuccino and espresso were prepared and served directly before the eyes -- and upset -- of attendees.
Judging from the numbers watching the food preparations take place, the interest level in the specialty market was large. And, many manufacturers agreed that the desire for specialty items is slowly increasing. However, according to some producers, only a few of the items now in the specialty niche are expected to profit from the increase in interest. In fact, most manufacturers of specialty products agreed that items such as pasta makers and ice cream manufacturers are leveling off either because of saturation in the market or because of what they predict overspecialization.

According to Lou Federico, divisional manager of kitchen products at Conair Corp., pastamakers and ice cream manufacturers are weakening. The reason, he explained, is these products need too much time and effort from consumers while delivering relatively few benefits and little convenience.
""We (Conair Corp.) have been assessing new niche categories. The market for pastamakers appears to be retrenching. Ice cream makers have also weakened. The biggest hangup in retail with ice cream manufacturers is the fact that it takes a lot of work to make something that's simpler to purchase already made."" Galileo Buzzi-Ferraris, president of Lello Appliances, distributor of Simac goods, concurred that interest in pastamakers is subsiding. He clarified that the availability of fresh pasta in many grocers' freezers has diminished the need for customers to exert the time and effort to make pasta at home.
Buzzi-Ferraris' view is that""the high-end ice cream business has been screwed-up when Donvier introduced its guide ice cream maker, which retails for just about $30."" Consequently, he said, prices for the whole marketplace were reduced. ""Now to sell huge numbers of (high end ) ice cream machines is quite hard,"" he added.

>> https://medium.com/@bestmasticatingjuic ... 01a47a8d59
In response to the Donvier unit, Simac is now offering the Gelato Pronto; a $79 manual ice cream maker. In accordance with Buzzi-Ferraris the reduced priced device is selling quite well. As for Donvier, federal sales manager Alice Shoemaker responded,""I don't believe we screwed it up,"" referring to reduced priced ice cream manufacturers. ""I think what we have done is altered the marketplace.""

Tom Fletcher, vice president of advertising at Gourmet Housewares, distributor of a line of Gaggia products, including a manual ice cream maker, also disagreed with Buzzi-Ferraris. He argued that lower priced ice cream manufacturers really extend the market. According to Fletcher,""There is a big difference between a $30 ice cream manufacturer and also a $600 unit"" He added that customers who purchase one would not be interested in the other.
One area where the two Gaggia's Fletcher and Simac's Buzzi-Ferraris did agree is the fact that cappuccino/espresso manufacturers are strong and should continue to rise tremendously. To fulfill the consumer demand for specialty coffee manufacturers, the two companies are marketing new blend cappuccino/espresso machines. ""Right now,"" said Fletcher,""cappuccino/espresso machines are in vogue, probably because customers are traveling more and therefore are exposed to various sorts of coffees. The American people as a whole is growing more sophisticated regarding the consumption of coffee and consequently they are looking for variety.""

Buzzi-Ferraris agreed. ""The cappuccino/espresso marketplace is big, and it is getting even larger. We are responding to this growing market by developing a fully automatic device that will make it even simpler to make espresso and cappuccino coffees. We'll introduce our newest cappuccino/espresso machine at the January Housewares Show (1990)."" According to Conair's Lou Federico, juicers and juice extractors are different examples of specialty items with growth potential.

>> https://www.facebook.com/Bestmasticatingjuicers.zones
""I visit two merchandise trends, first there is the juicer that squeezes out the juice of soft fruits and vegetables -- for example, oranges, grapefruits and berries. Then there's the juice extractor which pulls out juices from fruits and vegetables that don't seem juicy -- for instance, carrots, pears and apples. I think the products are being driven by the health trend, which has been around for a while and the diet craze, which frequently requires drinking considerable quantities of juices""
Presently, Conair Corp. is advertising a juicer and based on Federico, can be looking seriously at juice extractors. As with other manufacturers, Federico agreed that the secret to manufacturing specialty goods is twofold. ""Specialty electrics must provide benefits and conveniences,"" said Federico. ""If we (Conair) look at a specialty merchandise, we ask ourselves,'Can it be providing a benefit?' And'Can it be providing a benefit?' If the solution is no, we're not interested.""

He added,""We looked at breadmakers and decided it was too specialized. The final result is a small amount of bread which requires numerous hours to bake.""
On the flip side, Keizo Kawanishi, executive vice president of Zojirushi America Corp., pointed out that not all breadmakers are equally. By way of example, he said the Zojirushi breadmaker provides consumers versatility, he noted is an aspect many customers are searching for in specialty products.
""Other companies,"" explained Kawanishi,""have components that just bake bread. Our apparatus can bake cakes, bread and make jams. A great deal of people at the (Mid-Year) Show showed interest in our breadmakers. Consumers often get breadmakers for individual use, and later purchase them as presents.""",2

Macro perfomance slow when extracting table from javascript,"VERSION BUILD=11.5.498.2403,  Windows 7 , IE11

When I attempt to execute the macro from javascript  using iimPlay the macro runs for more than 30 minutes and never returns any results.  If I execute the same macro using iimPlay on a smaller table(12 rows) the macro returns the csv file.

*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

!WAITPAGECOMPLETE vs Wait Time,"I have a relatively slow loading set of pages that I am using to scrape data. Initially I had problems with the script getting ahead of itself and causing problems by advancing too quickly. I initially tried the Wait feature and that helped a lot. I later tried the !WAITPAGECOMPLETE command thinking that it would be a more efficient way of handling slow loading pages. Unfortunately, it doesn't work as well as putting in somewhat arbitrary Wait commands. I would still get some advancement to the next page when the first page wasn't complete yet.

Problem:
I am trying to write an iMacros script that checks a webpage, and in that webpage checks a specific webpage position for a specific text that is positioned always to the right of a naming text that always has the same position on that webpage (naming text is: ""Location:"") where the value of this specific text to the right of that naming text can change between 1 to 26 different values (say: A-Z), Once iMacros ""reads"" this specific text, then have iMacros take that specific text and look it up in a specific Excel file where that specific text has specific values (say: A to Z) located in column A and then have iMacros return the corresponding output value from column B (say: 101-126) on the same row.
How would I script this in iMacros?

I tried the below code, and this did not work.
Code: Select allURL GOTO=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office13\EXCEL.exe

Specifically, I am trying to retrieve the second link (the PDF file), named ""*"":


Specifically, when I use the ""record"" feature in iMacros and click on the link it retrieves the link as:

But when I mouse over the link it retrieves the ""name"" of the link as: ""URLID"" and the actual URL as: ""https://*/*.PDF"".

Using the code:
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=ID:URL$1 EXTRACT=HREF

But what code do I use to tell iMacros to:
1) take that actual URL it extracts and
2) use that actual URL it extracts, and then ""download""/""save target as"" that actual URL, so that the PDF that actual URL links to (since the actual URL ends in "".PDF"") actually downloads the PDF file?

I'm new to Imacros and to the community. 

I'm trying to figure out the following: 

1) Go to this State Gov't website (http://apps.dor.wa.gov/BRD/default.aspx#brdResults)

2) Search an entity (Amazon.com for example) from a list (a table in html format)

3) If the search returned multiple hits, do nothing and move on to the next entity on the list. 

4) If the search returned one hit, click on the result.

4) After clicking on the result, the next page will display the entity information (address, account open, etc).  Extract the information to a excel spreadsheet

5) download webpage and move on to next entity on the list and repeat.


Eventually, I would need to figure out how to repeat this process for different websites, but I'm hoping if I can get some help with the first one I can try to learn and figure out for others.

Trimming a word off the extract value using EVAL + .substr?,"iMacros for Firefox 9.0.3//Firefox 49.0.2//Windows 10 Pro [Eng]

So I'm going a little nuts here. I haven't used iMacros in a long time (last post on this account was 2011) and I seem to have forgotten a lot. But I had a problem automating some link clicking and I thought, hey that old iMacros extension might work! So here I am.

So my end goal for my script is to click on several hyperlinked downloads (.torrent files) to automate the downloading process for me.

First problem:
The amount of torrents on the page change, depending on what specific page you're looking at. Some pages on the site may have 7 torrents, others have 2.
Luckily the site lists the amount of torrents on a page in a text attribute (literal text is 'Torrents x').
So first, I need to extract the 'x'. Through quite a bit of searching, it seems the best way to do this is using EVAL + javascript to manipulate the extraction. I settled on using substr because I only need the last value for the extraction and the word Torrents is always the same amount of characters. This is what I have so far:
Code: Select allSET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO
TAG POS=1 TYPE=LI ATTR=TXT:Torrents:<SP>* EXTRACT=TXT
SET !VAR1 EVAL(""'{{!EXTRACT}}'.substr(10,1);"")
PROMPT {{!var1}}
Now, I know that I've got some wrong syntax in there, I'm just not fully understanding where it's at/what is wrong. I know it's something with the EVAL because if I just use SET !VAR1 {{!EXTRACT}} instead of the EVAL in the same code, I get the prompt: Torrents: x. So everything's working, all I want is the correct syntax for trimming Torrents:<SP> off and having VAR1=x.
--------------------------
My second problem (getting ahead of myself a bit here but better to ask now I guess):
This is the line of code to click on the download links. Basically there are multiple instances of this text on the page, all corresponding to links to different torrents. Each torrent link looks like this: 
[DownLoad]
So to find those links and click on them I use:
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:DownLoad
TAG POS=2 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:DownLoad
TAG POS=3 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:DownLoad
etc...
What I need is to use the VAR1 from my first problem above and have it define the maximum amount of TAG POS to use. Basically if there's 23 torrents on the site, I need it to run:
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:DownLoad
...
TAG POS=23 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:DownLoad.
How would I go about doing that? I understand I can use TAG POS={{!var1}} to find the final DownLoad but I'm not sure how to use that to count up or how to design it so it stops the code after a certain amount.

Hopefully I explained myself clearly enough, if you need anymore information feel free to ask me to clarify. There's probably a much simpler way of doing this but I'm obviously clueless as to what it is.",2
"Download pdf/audio/video from page, click next page do same","Dear friends, I hope I can find some help, is my first time with imacros (I know algorithms, but I've never used imacros).

I am a participant in a website with videos and study material in pdf, and I want to download them so I can watch and study offline.

So, I'm logged into the page, and I'm going to the course I want to download, link:
https: //www.****.com/course/cod/sc%6CTU1EaL7Z%9W/v/OQlrb2uhlnS%9W/c/KvcHnMerTdz%9W

I tried, with Chrome Imacros recording function of imacros to save  each action and repeating it to do the operation in next pages, I'll attach the script so you understand.

In the page, I download the video, I use the Adobe HDS / HLS Video Saver addon (withou imacros i can download any m3u8 with this addon), the link to open the addon is:
chrome-extension://pibndofbpkoaipoidbkephfhhnapkccn/download.html

Is possible record actions of a another addon? even if this addon is just a new tab with specifc functions?
In this link, the m3u8 file is brought by clicking on the link inside the addon, the addon joins the parts and the download of a unified file of the video.
Then I click clear and close the tab.

I go back to the first page, and I click to download the pdf booklet and then click to download the pdf slide and after downlaod the audiofile.

Then I click on the next page, where there same structure page with a new video and other materials and I have re-created the process on this new page.

However the script is static, I want to leave it dynamic, to go on going on each page by clicking the ""next page"" button and the materials being downloaded in each one.

Another detail, that in the static there are some problems, in this part:
GOTO URL = chrome-extension://pibndofbpkoaipoidbkephfhhnapkccn/download.html

imacros adds  ""http://"" and ignores after the ""extension"" the "":"" and try to open in the new tab like this, imacros try open this:
http://chrome-extension//pibndofbpkoaip ... nload.html

1 - How do I open it in the new tab exactly ""chrome-extension://pibndofbpkoaipoidbkephfhhnapkccn/download.html""    ?

2 - inside this addon page which is a new tab, it seems that imacros did not save the command to click on the link, which makes the addon download the m3u8 and merge all the videos into a single file.
So in this way, as the addon is not opened as per the link above, I can not download the m3u8 video. Its possible use this addon with imacros? if not, any another suggestions to download m3u8 using imacros?

3 - When imacros downloads the contents of this first page, it goes to the next page according to the next page button, but it does not downloads the contents of the second page, but download the contents of the same first page again.
How to make it go to the next page as the button and download the contents of the next page and not the first?

That is, I want to make this dynamic, I did the procedure 3 times to be easy to understand the static imacro to try to make it dynamic.
So I want do a dynamic imacro that will always click ""next page"" automatically regardless of how many pages it is and download the contents of each one of them.

In short, for the time being this static script can download the pdfs and the audio normally, is only with the problem that I mentioned in not downloading the contents of the next page and too the problem of not being able to download the m3u8 video with imacros using the HLS addon.

Problems with Tab opening and find the right atribute,"So, I'm kinda new to Imacros and have only basic knowledge. Long story short, from the  exhibitor list i have, on the exhibition site, i need to extract info about 'em.

https://ces18.mapyourshow.com/7_0/searc ... endrow=200 that's the list.

What i'm tring to do, is to make imacros open exhibitors page in a new tab, scrap the info i need, close it, and repeat with next inline 


 prim1 
 , but i can't find the way to do that, since href's or position arent specified. 
But that is just a part of the problem. Once in that page, i could tell imacros what to copy BUT the email, which i kinda need the most since it's position isnt specified either.

"HTML TYPE, Copy data to notepad","Hello everyone!

I am newbie here. 
I recorded a macro but it doesn't run, seems like the programming involve javascript functions.. I don't know if it's a problem.

Colon Distrupting The Extraction!!,"Firefox 55; imacros 8.9.7 ; Windows 7

I have been really familiar in coding in imacros, but
This is something new to me.
I found this kind of ID naming,
Code: Select all<div class=""_4-u2 mbm _4mrt _5jmm _5pat _5v3q _4-u8"" data-fte=""1"" data-ftr=""1"" id=""mall_post_1988260348080319:6:0"" role=""article""

Point here: mall_post_1988260348080319:6:0

And next problem, I can only use EVENT Javascript imacros to get it work.
So what I have done,

Extracting ID, and then assigned it to code like this
Code: Select alliimPlayCode (
	""EVENT TYPE=CLICK SELECTOR=\""#mall_post_""+ something +"":6:0>DIV>DIV>DIV:nth-of-type(2)>DIV>DIV>DIV>DIV>DIV>DIV>DIV>DIV>SPAN:nth-of-type(1)>DIV>A\"" BUTTON=0"" + ln
);

Point here: SELECTOR=\""#mall_post_""+ something +"":6:0

Notice the bolded stuff? Yeah you can then assume it won't work. The error message was this,
""Syntax error. [this is line of code] is not a valid selector, line 1 (Error code: -1001)""

I am not sure if I missed some other technique to do this. But really I was really sad if it couldn't be done.

Second, the site presents a table to click in anyone data (image1), I click in the line of the table, and the site goes to the table I want do extract the colum of ""Vlr Dispon閾唙el"" and below, ""Margem Livre"", right below ""Margem Livre"" (credit card) but I cant to find de right code to find the correct extraction on the table, in a correct column ""Vlr.

Scraping dynamic list of links with download filename,"This might be a dumb question, but is iMacros capable of saving all links of a particular class on a page and use the filenames specified in the ""download"" attribute?  Basically I'm using an eBay image scraping tool to generate a list of links to each of a listing's images at maximum resolution, but because of CORS limitations, I must right-click each link to get the save dialog box to use the filename in the ""download"" attribute.  This is fine if there are only a few images, but it gets tedious if a listing as more than a dozen images, so I'm hoping to use a macro to automate this.  Is iMacros what I want?  How would I got about ensuring that the specified filenames are used?

I am trying to save a captcha image and while it is saving an image it is saving the wrong part of the screen.

I am using:

version:

windows: 7

Tested in: imacros browser and imacros for IE


Here is my code:

TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=NAME:createaccount ATTR=NAME:newaccountcaptcha CONTENT=!VAR1
TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:CHECKBOX FORM=NAME:createaccount ATTR=NAME:TermsOfService CONTENT=YES

Everything runs fine but when it processes line 15 in the Imacros browser instead of the captcha image being saved it just saves a portion of the top left of the screen.  In the IE imacros browser it gives this error:
Error -1000: Cannot copy the item being saved to destination file: C:\captcha\captcha.jpg Unable to save screenshot of the current browser page.  Notice that only HTML documents are currently supported  (no PDF or office documents loaded via plugins). Line 15: TAG POS=1 TYPE=IMG FORM=NAME:createaccount ATTR=SRC:*https://accounts.google.com/Captcha?ctoken* CONTENT=EVENT:SAVEPICTUREAS

Which makes sense because there is no file type in the code of the page that specifies the type of file for the CAPTCHA image.  Instead there is a randomly generated ""key"" that is used to reference the image.

I feel very close to getting this to work but something is either out of place/sequence or the references are wrong somehow.

I've spent 3 hours on this and it's driving me nuts    Any ideas?",6
Download File in -silent mode,"iMacros V12.0.501.6698

Hi, I have set up an imacros vb script to login to a site and download a file - it is working when browser is being ran normally, but when I run it in -silent mode, which is what i would like to do, it is not able to download the file. I am unable to share the website.

ive got the full script running in chrome. When I run the script in silent mode it does download a file but the file is named ""download"" -- which is the text of the download button, and contains this message:

The part of the script that is downloading the file is the td[6] in the below. I have tried this using the imacros browser, ie, and chrome --

Does anyone know how I can get this to download in silent mode? I am open to using any browser.

I get the desired extracted text (however, as mentioned above, the number of ""rows""  can vary and is not always only three.

Advise on what I may be doing wrong with !ENDOFPAGE (and or alternative I should be using) is much appreciated.

macro slows down,"I'm using iMacros to loop through a list of purchase orders on a company owned web site.  It seems like the macro  slows down the longer it goes.  I'm not sure if it is the web site or something with my code.  Below is some of the code to show how the macro works.  The rest of the code is very similar to the examples below.  It's similar to code I've used in the past.  Is there any options or settings that I could change to speed up the macro or is the result of the underlying application?

Negative Relative Extraction Problem,"Hi All,
A total Newbie to iMacros and looking for some help from a more experienced user.

I have a problem with the negative relative extraction on eBay.com

Windows XP SP2
iMacros v6.2
Office 2003 - Using Excel VBA to control the iMacros Browser

I was trying to extract data from the ebay.com website.  The listings are in batches of 50.  I can extract the first 49 items and then it fails on the 50th.  I have tried displaying 100 auctions to a page and it extracts the first 99 items and fails on the 100th - - the 50th items extracts OK in this instance.  I have looked at the source of the eBay page and can see no difference in the formatting of the last item on each page.

To replicate, goto http://www.ebay.com and search for 'toner' (for example) -- at the time of writing there are 24,000+ items for 'toner' split over multiple pages.  I have created a sample macro which demonstrates the problem.  It extracts items 1, 2, 49, and 50 (note:  In my VBA code, I use a loop and pass a variable called Pos to iMacro, change the page and then repeat the process).  The logic I use is to find the time left on the page and then using negative relative positioning to extract the link which conforms to the following syntax - http://cgi.ebay.com/*.

Once you have navigated to the search results, run the simple macro below from within the browser.
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:time*
TAG POS=R-1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:*&&HREF:http://cgi.ebay.com/* EXTRACT=HREF
TAG POS=2 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:time*
TAG POS=R-1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:*&&HREF:http://cgi.ebay.com/* EXTRACT=HREF
TAG POS=49 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:time*
TAG POS=R-1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:*&&HREF:http://cgi.ebay.com/* EXTRACT=HREF
TAG POS=50 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:time*
TAG POS=R-1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:*&&HREF:http://cgi.ebay.com/* EXTRACT=HREF


The first 3 items - 1,2 and 49 extract correctly.  The last item - 50th - fails with #EANF#.

Any suggestions.  I doubt it is a bug with iMacros, but any pointers on my code to do the extract would be appreciated.

Cheers

Opening the Extract Wizard in the iMacros Browser,"I would like to try the Extract Wizard which is described in some articles and tutorials but from what I've read it does not exist in the Firefox version of IMacros (which is what I've been using).  I had no luck installing the Chrome version of IMacros, so that leaves the IMacros Browser.  I'd like to open the IMacros Browser anyway because a lot of tutorials are written from that point of view. 

From what I've read, the independent IMacros browser should launch if I click on iMacros.exe in the Program Files folder. ( It's version 12.0.501.2305. )

However that click results only in an informational sales page which bears no resemblance to the browser depicted in various articles.  In addition, that page ""freezes"" on the screen so that I can get rid of it only with the task manager and sometimes only by rebooting!

I may have been reading outdated instructions on launching the browser.  How do I do it in the current version 12.0.501.2305?

Thanks!",1
how to carry TAB memory from one macro to another,"Hello;

The only way I have found that kind of works is to append a 'spacer' (""//"") after each extract, which at least allows me to count back the number of columns to reformat with the missing info, and then deleting all the placeholder columns. This can get very tedious when dealing with hundreds of records. 

Is there not a better way?

how to loop from certain line of script,"Hi;
running FF 55.0.3 on Win 7 32 bit, imacros ver. v8.9.7

I did use the script on this thread with the help of chivracq
http://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php? ... ail#p70484

but I want to do little more on this, and struggle to make it work,
I want the script skip one or few lines of script and continue.
but I could not figure it out how to do it with imacros, I am not sure if this can be done with imacros coding.
found some js loop script on this site, none I could use for this.

I don't think it is needed to paste the script from the link above, because I need only make the loop thing works.
this is what I want to do:

1- TAB 1- go to google and do a search
2- extract the content of the first page results, and click to the next page of the result
3- TAB 2 ,go to second url e.g. xyz.com
4- paste the data in there, extract new data
5- save the new data to a file
6- go back to line 2( which is On TAB 1, the second page of google result)


and continues to line 5, and then again from line 2.
so it is a loop, only the first time it starts at line 1, the second time and further starts from line 2 until the number of loops ends

I need it to set a number of loops as well, I don't want to do the loop unlimited.

appreciate any help on this.",2

*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

Help on removing comma in numbers and saving,"Hi, I'm completely new to iMarcos and I'm trying to use it to extract some numbers from a webpage. Somehow I'm making it to work, but since those numbers are formatted with commas, I need to remove them in order to read them to database.

Below code somehow worked to remove those commas, but a new issue of it is that once I save to the csv, iMacros doesn't translate the [EXTRACT] into comma. It just puts something like 123[EXTRACT]456[EXTRACT]789[EXTRACT] exactly into the csv.

Am I using a wrong way to remove commas from extraction? Or I'm missing something in the extraction saving? Struggling about this for days and I couldn't solve. Can experts here help? Thank you very much.

Those prompts are for me to keep track of results. The date adding action is used to add a date for the extraction in which it shouldn't be related to my problems.

"Different behaviour - scripting vs manual, with AJAX request","Hi all

Our ISP provides an online web site, where you can download a CSV of usage data.
I am attempting to write a tool that extracts this data for each of our customers only a regular basis, and injects it into a database so they can easily retrieve a graphical representation

There are two views of data - summary and detailed.
When I login to the website manually, the process is URL for login screen -> TAG enter details -> click A 'Detailed' -> click A 'Download Usage' -> click BTN 'Download'
The CSV that downloads shows detailed usage data.

I have built this behaviour into iMacros, using recording and some manual adjustments for additional waiting.
But the downloaded CSV is always only the 'summary' data - not the detailed.

I have confirmed by watching the script that iMacros does trigger the click on the A tag 'Detailed', which in theory is what 'switches' the behaviour of the Download button to download detailed data.
But the downloaded CSV is only ever summary view. I can even perform the same behaviour side-by-side, in a Chrome window manually on the right and iMacros 12 built-in browser on the left, and the output from iMacros is summary whereas the output from Chrome is detailed. Interestingly though - when I navigate the page using the iMacros built-in browser manually, it correctly registers that I've clicked on 'Detailed' view and downloads the full detailed CSV.

The website is very AJAX-heavy, to load in controls and data (hence having to build in plenty of additional WAIT commands). 
My thinking is that the built-in iMacros browser is not handling some form of local cache/cookie/session storage command from the website, whereas Chrome et al does.
As an example, in the Chrome developer when switching back forth between 'summary' and 'detailed' view (before downloading the CSV) this error is logged;
VM127:3 [Deprecation] 'window.webkitStorageInfo' is deprecated. Please use 'navigator.webkitTemporaryStorage' or 'navigator.webkitPersistentStorage' instead.

If I'm right, and the website is storing the 'current' view (detailed) in some kind of local storage, is there any way to replicate this behaviour in iMacros?

I've checked the 'Application' tab in Chrome developer console, and can't see any obvious setting stored in Local Session Storage or Cookies, just a SESSION_ID which doesn't help.
I've also tried to run my iMacros script in the main 3 browsers;
- IE 11 worked to load the web page, but no fields were ever filled in on the login page
- Chrome & Firefox were completely unresponsive when I click 'Play in -> ...' in the Script Editor

Only the built-in iMacros browser works, and it comes very close to what's needed by just refuses to 'remember' that it's clicked 'Detailed View' before it downloads
Note that I've tried clicking both the 'Detailed' and 'Download' buttons as both TAGs and EVENTs

I'm using iMacros 12 on Windows 10
If anyone has any suggestions relating to tricks for handling AJAX-heavy pages, ideas about how to force iMacros to 'fully register' a click on an AJAX page, or tips for getting iMacros to work with Chrome on Windows 10 I'd appreciate it

Regards,
Sam",4
Zooming,"New iMacros user here.  I have a web page that is being displayed differently on standard aspect monitors than on their widescreen counterparts (the components I'm using in the macro aren't even present in the trunctated version!).  I have tried various resizing to no avail, but have noticed that when I zoom out the web page is rebuilt with the components I need!  I've searched these forums and the wiki to no avail.  I have tried each recording method and none of them pick up my zooming (ctrl + / ctrl -).  Has anybody successfully gotten zooming to work with IE?

Using JQuery with iMacros,"Greetings all, I am a long time lurker first time poster. 

I've found a few posts on the web about using JQuery in iMacros but none seem to work.

Here is one:
Code: Select allfunction loadScriptFromURL(url) {
    var request = Components.classes['@mozilla.org/xmlextras/xmlhttprequest;1'].createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsIXMLHttpRequest),
        async = false;
    request.open('GET', url, async);
    request.send();
    if (request.status !== 200) {
        var message = 'an error occurred while loading script at url: ' + url + ', status: ' + request.status;
        iimDisplay(message);
        return false;
    }
    eval(request.response);
    return true;
}

// load JQuery
loadScriptFromURL('http://mysupersecret.blob.core.windows.net/share/jquery-2.0.3.min.js');
$ = window.$,
JQuery = window.JQuery;

Is this correct? Do I have to add this to each macro I plan to use it with or can I reference it somehow?  I've tried adding it to a js file with JQuery but it doesn't like the line ""$ = window.$,""

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!

Help: How to capture LinkedIn Search results?,"Hi everyone

I'm new to iMacros and would really appreciate a little bit of newbie help to get me started.

I'm trying to figure out how to capture my LinkedIn search results but it seems really difficult to do 

If any of you iMacro gurus had a script snippet or example you could share it would be a huge help to me!

What I want to do is... do a search (eg for 2nd level connections) and then capture the results.

Specifically:

+ name
+ title
+ profile link
+ number of shared connections

... and then go through X pages of search results saving the data to a text file


I've found plenty of things related to profiles but nothing related to the search results page.

Hope someone might be able to share an example.

Thanks everyone for making this forum great.

Half of extracted data goes into 1 cell the rest is seperate,"Hey guys, 

I need help with a couple things.  I have created a macro to go into a webpage and download a table and create an excel file.  Easy enough.

When the table has a small amount of information it puts all of the information into one cell as one long string.  This is ok because I have created a VBA script to split the text and format it how I want.

The problem I am having is that when I download the table and it has a lot of information for a whole month it will put the first half of the report all into one cell and then the second half goes into individual rows.

The macro I have created can't work with both formats.  Is there something I can do when I extract to either have it all go into one cell or have them all go into individual rows but not both?

Search Results,"Being new to iMacros, I'm attempting to write a macro to process through a search of names.
I've looked at the documentation and search the forum, but didn't find any examples of what I need to do.
Seems like it would be simple to do, but so far, nothing I've tried works. Could be my syntax of just not using the
command correctly.
Here is the issue: after a user logs in, they need to enter a persons last name to do a search on that.
I prompt for the name and store it in var1, that part works okay.
Once I use that in the search, the search sometimes returns maybe 25 or more last name, first name pairs that
might stretch over 7, 8, 9 pages.
The user then negotiates over those pages till they find a match.
Could be anywhere, say it's on page 4.
I then need to capture the results of that exact match and then use that data later one.
This is what I have

I've tried a number of solutions, nothing has worked. 
Here is one example of what I tried with the select command:

LinkedIn tagging question,"Windows 10
iMacros for Firefox. VERSION BUILD=9030808
Firefox 54.0.1 (32-bit)

Hi all,

I have a LinkedIn profile scraper that extracts profile data into a CSV (code at bottom of post). It does the job very well, with one key caveat: it can't account for instances where a piece of information is missing from a section of the profile. As an example, see this profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/darylpereira/

Look at the second position in Daryl's profile and note that he did not include a date range. My program is trained to find position 2 and print it, then find date range 2 and print it. But it can't tell when there is no date range 2. Instead, the date range associated with the 3rd position will be considered the second date range. The result is that the dates are off for him (I have him joining IBM in this capacity in Nov 2005, he really joined in Sep 2008). Many, many profiles have this issue. I need the date range data to be accurately attributed to the positional and educational data. Otherwise, it's not useful for the analysis.

I believe the answer is that I need to be using a python or other coding interface so that I can integrate if/else functionality. But I'm really hoping someone might have a workaround for iMacros, because I'm not any good at coding. Anyway, all ideas are appreciated.

Extract data from an empty cell,"Hi,

I am not a professional programmer, but I am doing a small code to extract customer information from a corporate intranet.  

For every client there are several orders, but only one will be avaible (DISPONIBLE).  When the code finds an avaible order, it goes to delivery note url to extract the lines of the items: date, description and dispatched, and normally there are 4 rows.  If the date is empty, dispatched too.

I need that when one row has no date, it skips to the next.  With my code, the second open TAB (delivery note) doesn't close when any date is empty and then the extraction stops.

How do I make it jump to the next row to extract data when the date is empty?

Thanks.

iimGetLastExtract() doens't work,"Hello,

Checking for a word in .csv file,"CIM iMacros for FF v9.0.3 Firefox 54.0 Windows 10

I want to check some data from .csv file with random word from site. If that word exists - to do something and if the word doesn't exist - to do something else. But I didn't find anything similar. EVAL function should do that but I don't know how to check whole .csv 

Example:
.csv file example.csv

content from example.csv is

science

If I check the word science then it does one operation and if the word is clinic then something else. Is this possible with iMacro and .csv file

If yes, just give me some directions, please. If not, sorry for taking your time, simple no is just fine.

Getting function Expected when tyring to use reverse(),"Configuration: Surface Pro 2, Win 10, Firefox 53, iMacros Standard Edition (x86) Version 11.0.246.4051
Hi,
I am trying to split out the house address from the total extract.
The Web page HTML has a line break<br> between the name line section and start of address, but when extracted it doesn't appear as extracted=HTM shows the two fields run together ""<SP>lastnamehousenumber<SP>"" with no delimiter. However, I was able to split them using regex on white space.
Since the address fields are always represented the same way my goal is to separate house address, reverse it and split by index, o being zip, 1 being state, 2 being city and 3 the address. That way I don't have to worry about complex address parsing.

Is there a way to put user-entered data into a variable?

I had been using PROMPT to capture user input data as a variable...

PROMPT ""Please enter text:"" !VAR1

Unfortunately, PROMPT no longer works with the latest Chrome update. 

I've come up with the following workaround that EXTRACTs the user input from an html form I created.  But I can't pass that data along because EXTRACT is not a variable and IEXTRACT does not work within a TAG.  I've spent a lot of time with this and I haven't found a way to do this.  Is there a way to load TAG EXTRACT'd data into a variable?

Use ONWEBPAGEDIALOG with the MACRO parameter,"I have a macro that populates a WebPage Dialog box.  It was working until just recently.  We have incorporated the information on how to ""Use ONWEBPAGEDIALOG with the MACRO parameter"".  There are 2 issues: 

(1)There are 2 text boxes and 2 drop downs with start and end time.  Following these instructions, I can record changing the text boxes but the drop downs are frozen.  Is this part of iMacros or some option in IE?

(2) When I record changing the text boxes, I compare it to the existing code and it is identical.  I even pasted over the existing code with what I recorded.

When I run the macro, I get an error code -1300.  It is erroring out on the following line:

TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=NAME:popupForm ATTR=NAME:eventDesc CONTENT=Memorial<SP>Day

This is the first line in the RFSDialgCHECK.iim.  I'm not sure what it can't find this element when it is what is recorded in iMacros.

Following is the code that runs the the RFSDialgCHECK.iim:

Extracted Data in different columns no placeholder anymore,"Anybody have any ideas? On the 8.9 build, when the macro didn't have any data to extract, it would fill in eanf. This would keep all the data extracted in the same column, neat and easy to filter. Now, when nothing is there, it simply moves the data over, so I end up with something like this:

A	B	C	D
A	B	C	D
A	C	D	
B	D		
B	C	D	

Instead of this

A	B	C	D
A	B	C	D
A	#EANF#	#EANF#	D
#EANF#	B	C	D

Apart from using the older build, is there any fix for this? Basically, I want eanf or some other placeholder for when no data is extracted, so the columns are easily filtered.",8
Issue Extract with firefox plugin,"Browser: Firefox 53.0.2 (32 bit)
S.O. Windows 8.1 Pro
plug in: iMacros for Firefox 9.0.3 (updated April, 24. 2017)

-----------------------

Hello, 

First of all , sorry for my bad english. 

I'm having an issue extracting TXT when in the middle of the text to extract there are Bold or Italic characters. It happens with Firefox plugin.

iMacros program works properly

I've changed the demo page (http://demo.imacros.net/Automate/Extract2) HTML to test if the problem was caused for the web page where I want to extract The text.

I've added bold characters in the middle of the phrase like this:
""The second line is extracted too"" for ""The second line is extracted too"".

In HTML: 

<td style=""width: 52%; outline: 1px solid blue;"" class=""bdytxt"">
 This line is extracted.<br>
 The <strong>second line</strong>
 is extracted, too.
</td>

Running this macro:

VERSION BUILD=8031994
TAB T=1
SET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO
URL GOTO=http://demo.imacros.net/Automate/Extract2
TAG POS=1 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:bdytxt&&TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=* FILE=+_{{!NOW:yyyymmdd_hhnnss}}

the result is: 

This line is extracted.
TheThis line is extracted.
Thesecond lineis extracted, too.

instead of:

This line is extracted.
The second line is extracted, too.


It seems as the extracted text repeats himself when finds the bold tag (<strong>)

Thank You in advance",3
Extracting an image from a website into a new folder.,"Hello,

As stated in the title, I have looked within the iMacros Wiki and am looking for an option to save a new image from a website and put the image into a new folder each time the script is run. I noticed the SAVETARGETAS function and seem like there is some possibility with this command.

However, is it even possible for this option with just the iMacros language? Or will I have to seek out this possibility with Javascript, C#, etc.

Thanks for any help that may be submit as I have been working for this solution for a few days now. ",4
Extract blank when tag fails,"Hello,

I'm using iMacro's build 9030808 for Firefox 53.0.2 (32-bit) on Windows 7. I've been using iMacros to scrape social media profiles for certain pieces of information. Because information on the platform is self-reported, certain pieces of info are often missing, resulting in the tag failing. Ultimately, this means a lot of work for me on the back end sorting the data so that each piece of information is in the correct column. Instead, I'd like to extract a blank each time the program fails to find a piece of information.

I've looked all over the forums, but have yet to find a solution for this yet. This one appears to come close, but was never resolved. http://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=25503

I imagine the solution would involve the EVAL function, but I don't have any experience in javascript. Is there an obvious way to do this? I've pasted an example script below for context:

it seems they hide a HTM content or using any javascript to hide.

is there any method to reveal a content when scraping?

Web Scraping Table With SPAN Class,"Hello iMacros Community,

I'm brand new to iMacros, but I have spent a lot of time watching YouTube videos and browsing this forum. However, I haven't been able to figure out how to do this quite yet.

My company uses an eCRM system that loads via Internet Explorer 11, and I am able to get iMacros to go through all of the login process and get to the point where I'm ready to extract records. I can even get it to extract the first row of records. However, I cannot get it to go down to the next row, and extract it. Each of my attempts either involve it scraping the first line multiple times, or in an #EANF# error after the first row.

My code is below:
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=11.5.498.2403
TAB T=1
TAB CLOSEALLOTHERS
FRAME NAME=WorkAreaFrame1

'Forward button for next page of results. Need to push if exists, and grab next list.
'TAG POS=4 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:th-clr-span EXTRACT=TXT

I do have some commented out lines, until I can figure out how to get the scraping of one list of results. The hard part is that this list can contain up to a maximum of 200 results. If there are more than 200 results, it would need to push the ""Next"" button (TAG POS at the very bottom of the code above), then extract those results as well until the ""Next"" button could not be pressed again.

Each row is indicated in the string at the very end, surrounded in []. So, Code: Select allTAG POS={{!LOOP}} TYPE=SPAN ATTR=ID:C17_W66_V67_V76_items_table[1].objectid EXTRACT=TXT would then go to the below for the next line, and so on. Code: Select allTAG POS={{!LOOP}} TYPE=SPAN ATTR=ID:C17_W66_V67_V76_items_table[2].objectid EXTRACT=TXT

*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

Thank you for helping us to help you better!",1
Extracting and comparing variable data.,"Hi everyone,

I am new to this and I was wondering if it is possible to complete this action.

I want to set up a web macro on firefox to output the matching results of the data I input.

On a webpage I have to frequently enter a lot of data into three text boxes, all the data are just a series of random numbers pretty much, the goal of the macro would be to extract all the data from box 1 and box 3 and output which  of the numbers numbers match, after this though, the numbers of which are in the outpoint (the matching numbers from box 1 & 3) if any of these numbers also show up in box 2 to take those away those away from the final output. An example of this I will show below. 

Box 1 
12345 3233 23232 3232 2323 232 23233
54543 54543 545  5455   54543 54557 7776
Box 2 
3233 23232 5454 6565 65657
Box 3
12345 3233 23232 3232 2323 232 23233
7477 7372 87499 9937 3773 9922 9933 

So the final output would be:- 12345 3232 2323 232 23233

I hope this makes sense  if anyone could help or point me in the right direction, would much appreciated  it.

TAG and SEARCH parameters,"And now for Part II of http://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=27429
One possible outcome of a friend search on FriendlyFriends.com is that a friend was not found. In that case, the resulting web page contains the following:
<div id=""FriendListing"" class=""NoFriend"">
	<p class=""NoFriendSummaryText"">I'm sorry, but your friend was not found.
        </p>
</div>
If I get this result then I want to append the csv record with some relevant notation but I first have to detect this result instead of other possible results. I tried the following but neither work:

Both the macro fails at both cases at the above line.
I think either command will work and I think I just need help with the parameters. I found the above by searching the demo macros and command reference and forum but didn't find an exact solution. Thanks in advance for any help fixing the parameters (ideally for both options).

hi,

I am trying to loop my macro code to extract the data from different tabs of a weboage to a csv file.

Is there any way by which i can extract the data of every tab (in every loop) in a new page of the same csv/excel file.

the basic idea is to avoid  complications of creating so many files. and saving the data in same file but different tabs.

Perhaps we can't extract data in excel with imacro.

but still looking forward to see a solution to it.

Please help...

Thank you.",2

E-mail triggers Website - Assistance Appreciated,"Ok, so what i'm attempting to accomplish is to scan my gmail for a specific subject line and if available then go to a URL and login automatically. I also want it to check if the website is already logged in and if not than login (website times out after like 10-20 minutes or so). What I have written so far is the macro opens up my gmail, clicks on an e-mail with a subject verbiage that I have provided then I open a 2nd Tab, navigate to the URL and Login. All this works however the below is what im missing that i'm unable to figure out:

1 - Scan gmail until the e-mail with that specific subject line is available (I dont actually need to click on the e-mail, i just need to know its available as this will be my trigger to navigate to a website).
2 - If e-mail available, navigate to the website but if the site directs me back to the login page than login (I have the login macro all setup just need to know how to identify if website is logged in or not).
3 - I dont want the macro to keep looping through if an e-mail is found and the website is open. only loop (scan) if e-mail not available and website (tab-2) closed.

Below is what I have so far. If anyone could provide assistance that would be appreciated. BTW, my gmail is set to Basic HTML as I read that would be better for iMacro. I'm open to opinions on this as well.

As you can see only 1 number is changing. My first question: Is it possible to extract href from these selectors?

Code: Select all<div class=""gs-per-result-labels"" url=""http://this-is-what-i-want-to-extract.html""></div>

I tried by scraping by XPATH but it seem not to work (I think because imacros cant find these elements in source code). Do you have any tips for me?

I need to automate the following task: copy a cell from a csv file, paste it to google.com/finances search area, get search result, scroll down, copy industry and sector and paste this info to the csv file. My issue is that my macro seems copying everything from the web page and I get industry and sector just on the line 498 of my csv file. 
And I have a couple more questions: how could I avoid it throws me an error if google doesn't find anything, or it runs into an empty cell on my csv file?
I will really appreciate your help.

Extract current selected dropdown into variable,"Hello iMacros pros!

Does anyone know a solution to get iMacros to extract the word as it is written on the page?

Also, I'm running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 if that matters.

Also, when I remove the ""SET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO"" so that iMacros shows a prompt with the extracted text the characters display properly in the prompt window, so it's only a problem in the csv file.",6

Having issue with extracting information by following links,"Imacros version: 10

The sample scripts work and I am using visual studio to code the scripts.

This is what I am trying to do and it is for personal use so that I can choose the best dentist for my needs. I want to go to google and extract their healthgrade, vitals.com ratings.  For the healthgrade ratings, sometimes the rating is right on the google search results page and I sometimes have to click on the results link to scrape the ratings from the actual healthgrades site. For vitals.com ratings I will always have to click on the link to get the ratings from vitals.com.  The issue I'm having is this: I can can follow the correct links to vitals.com and healthgrades.com and extract the info but for some reason when I issue the BACK command to navigate back to the previous google results page to continue, the extract variable it seems is completely cleared and I only get the last extraction info into the csv file.  Is imacros capable of extracting info by following a multi level link structure?  (e.g. is it possible to retain the extracted data when you navigate into and out of links in the same macro?

On behalf of Progress, thank you for your continued partnership and commitment. 

Sincerely,

*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

Scraping email without opening email client,"Hello!

I am trying to scrape the email of Amazon reviewers who reviewed our products. However, there is just a ""Send an email"" link, and extracting from it only arrives at javascript:void(0). Only after clicking on this link, does it display the actual email of the reviewer. Then it is possible to scrape it.

The issue is that we need to scrape many emails and clicking on ""Send an email"" opens Outlook. I would need to either be able to extract the email without clicking on ""Send an email"", or make it so that iMacros clicks on it but it does not open the email client. I can't do that simply by changing the configuration in my computer, as this scraper would be used by many people. 

Here is an example page: http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2 ... tbl_3_name

Extracting ""Send an email"" so that it doesn't follow the link does not work either, as I need to actually click on the link instead of just tagging it. Could you guys help?? Thank you very much!",2
Getting data from the screen that is NOT in the source,"Hi

I am trying to get the data from a webpage. But the data doesn't exist in the page source. I am guessing it is generated by javascript/ajax or something. It is an email address. And in page source it looks like this:
Code: Select all<a id=""/gp/profile/A225AROJV5PA03"" class=""a-link-normal pr-email"" href=""javascript:void(0)"">Send an Email</a>

So, the link on the screen says ""Send an Email"". When you click on that link, it changes to an email address. But the email address is nowhere in the html.

Using iMacros, I can easily identify the link as id:/gp/profile/A225AROJV5PA03 and I can extract the text ""Send an Email""

But I want to extract the email address itself.

Does anyone know how to do this?",2

How to extract results from haveibeenpwned.com,"I am trying to extract the output of queries submitted to haveibeenpwned.com. (Great website BTW!) 

You enter an email address and it returns a result basically saying ""Good News"" or ""Oh No"". I just want to know if the email address is ""Good News"" answer. If it's an ""Oh No"" answer then I want iMacros to return something else like #EANF (I can sort emails later) 

This ought to be easy, but the issue is that the HTML  has both answers, so whether the page is showing ""Good News"" or ""Oh No"", iMacros can see both answers because both are present in the HTML but only one is displayed. 

How can I distinguish between the displayed answer and the hidden answers and just capture the displayed answer. 

Here's a simple example:
TAB T=1
'URL GOTO=https://haveibeenpwned.com/ - just open this page and leave it open

SAVE PDF - Download not finished,"Hey guys,

I am currently using IMacros V11.1.495.5175, Firefox 48, Windows 7 German.

I have a problem with a website where I am trying to download a pdf and the saved file is not completed. 
Instead of a pdf file I get a file which has the extension ""Datei"" and the size it's lower than what it should be (eg. 200kb downloaded out of 344kb).

My code is:

var xpath = ""//ul[@class='techRefContentList']/li["" + i + ""]/div/a""; //I am using xpath to find the <a> tag of the pdf 
var pdf_extract_macro = ""CODE: ONDOWNLOAD FOLDER=* FILE=myfile.pdf WAIT=YES"" + ""\n"";//I set the default download folder because I know there are some issues with it if I try to put a preferential folder (pls tell me otherwise..I really need a preferential folder)
pdf_extract_macro += ""TAG XPATH="" + '""' + xpath + '""' + "" CONTENT=EVENT:SAVEITEM"" + ""\n"";//saving the pdf when the download begins
iimPlay(pdf_extract_macro);

When I look in the download folder, I find a ""Datei"" file that I can't use so I'm guessing the download stops mid way.
This code is being run on two other websites and the pdf is downloaded fine on those.
On this particular site the download link is not in the href but in an onaction property. I don't know if that is the reason why the download is stopping. 

What could I do to make it wait until it's finished ? 

WAIT #ONDOWNLOADCOMPLETE# it's not supported
I was thinking of using !DOWNLOADED_SIZE to check if the download is finished but I don't know how to get the full size of the pdf to compare them.

I'm kind of stuck right now.

My solution was to set the browser to save the pdf in the download folder when the download begins and just TAG the <a>.
This works but I can't set the files name and it's a pain to go trough all the pdfs to find the one I'm looking for.

Any help is greatly appreciated guys.

Thank you !",9

Facebook has this next picture button when i click on the picture and what i am trying to do is to make imacros click on that next image button till the image runs out and save them into a folder i've designated. 

Also, when i try to take a screenshot of the user feed. THere are two problems.
1. I want imacros to scroll to the end of the page in facebook but since facebook doesnt load all the page in once and loads each page only when i reach the end of page, i'm not sure how i can capture them all
2. I want to also include all comments in the imacros page. So i will be taking automatic screenshots after imacros clicks for example, ""show 3 more comments"" i'm not sure how to make imacros click all of the ""show more comments option"" before it saves a screenshots.

LOL sorry if i asked too many questions.
I'll appreciate if anyone can help!
thanks in advance!",2

Extract portion of data,"Configuration: Surface Pro 2, Win 10, Firefox 47.0.1, iMacros Standard Edition (x86) Version 11.0.246.4051

Hi, 
I am trying to extract just the data highlighted in the CMA example. I have tried  both normal POS as well as relative. Both will work but the problem is that it ""extracts"" all three categories and saves as one set of data IE: 121119013434. I have tried many iterations of the extract statement to try and drill down to specific data( 1901) but to no avail. For what it is worth I have attached the web pages HTML. Is there any way to accomplish this?
Thanks",8
Accessing content window - Multiprocess Firefox,"Hey guys,

I am currently using IMacros V11.1.495.5175, Firefox 48, Windows 7 German.
I am writing the code in js and calling iMacros from there.
I just ran into an issue and I don't know if it's going to be a problem in the future.

I have this line: 
final_macro += ""ADD !EXTRACT "" + '""' + lager_col2[0].textContent + '""' + ""\n"";	

When I ran my js in the browser I got this error:
Error: Accessing content window is not supported in multiprocess Firefox, line 208 (Error code: -991)

Should I be worried ? Is the use of textContent forbidden ? 
The problem is that ""lager_col2[0]"" sometimes happen to be a link and I only want the text inside the link, not the tags and everything. So naturally I went with textContent. 
How could I get around this ?麓

Additionally, am I setting myself up for trouble when trying to access certain nodes with the use of window.document.getElementsByClassName ? 
I feel like everyone is going to advise me against it but it was easier than using the traditional TAG POS/XPATH/etc

Thank you !",4
detect dynamic content,"hi guys first of all i am terribly sorry i posted the wrong title i am not really sure what to write as i am really new to programming and this is my 1st time to try imacro before buying. I only want to accomplish a simple task that is to detect a certain content from a page. Sorry i dont know what terms to use maybe ill just explain it a bit more.

Pls bear with me here is an image of what the website script does and what i want to accomplish



this is how the code on the website looks like
Code: Select all<form action=""#"" method=""get"" id=""form1"">
 Guess the 1st letter of my name: <input type=""text"" name=""gletter""><br>
</form>

<button type=""submit"" form=""form1"" value=""Submit"">Submit</button>

<div class=""data-outcome item"">
   <!-- ajax result -->
</div>


everytime you press submit a result will show inside <!-- ajax result --> and the code will be
Code: Select all <div class=""inner-item"">
   <div class=""icon-correct"">W<span></span></div>
</div>


if i guess it correctly and
Code: Select all<div class=""inner-item"">
   <div class=""icon-lose"">L<span></span></div>
</div>


if i guess it wrong

so the code looks like this after every guess
Code: Select all<div class=""data-outcome item"">
        <div class=""inner-item"">
            <div class=""icn-win"">W<span></span></div>
        </div>
</div>

i already have an imacro code that letting me guess automatically

the code above allows me to guess 3 times actually, it can be 4 or 5 doesnt matter. What i want to do is detect the code if its a win or lose after i click the submit button, if i won and guess it correctly script will stop and go back from start and i lose script will continue until done.

i hope i have explained it well, simple tasks yet very hard for me to even explain it haha so you be the judge

thanks a lot in advance

Loop through results,"Hi everyone.

I need to extract data from a site. There is a simple SELECT option, an INPUT, and a SEARCH BUTTON. So far so good.

Now, the result pages, are not paginated in the traditional way. There is no link to Page 1/2/...., only next page button, which is an input, and it acts like a submit. This input has a NAME attribute, which, on the last page is missing. This is fine with me, because the macro will stop automatically once finished. 

I need to go through all the pages, and extract the data. Now bear with me, I've started to look into iMacros only yesterday, so I'm not really familiar with all the options..
This is the code I've came up so far, and it works for the first page:

' goto next page
TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:SUBMIT FORM=ID:chofcomelicensingpresentationnainaformEofcomInaSearchForm ATTR=NAME:getNextInaPage
' *** end block of loop

I've tried to Code: Select allSET !LOOP 25and start the macro in loop mode, but it doesn't work, plus I don't know beforehand how many result pages would be.
From my researches over the net couldn't figure out how to achieve that. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I am using the free iMacros Firefox extiension (latest, downloaded yesterday), in Debian 8.5, but I also have an XP machine with the trial iMacros Version 11.1.

Note: before someone would complain about legal issues related to scraping data, I have to mention that my company contacted the owners of the site, and asked for an API, which is not available, and they suggested to use the search page instead.

After clicking on last element (TAG POS=1 TYPE=NOBR ATTR=TXT:Poll) JavaScript adds Poll to the form of new post and not to an existing post that I'm editing.

Looks like it happens because of they are using same function with same class, so I've started to look around in order to find the way how to fix it, but I still can't find the way after hours of searching, reading and experimenting.

Automate a filling form with a massive .csv in a table,"Hello!
- iMacros Version: 8.9.70.419
- Browser:Firefox: 47.0.1
- OS: Windows 10 Pro

I need your help regarding the performance of this script I have built in iMacros. It's doing sort of what I intend, sort of  
I want to load some basic information in a couple of text boxes everytime I click on the element (where the loop should be placed)
ctl00_PlaceHolderMain_BandejaEntidades_LstBandejaEntidades_ctrl{{!LOOP}}_LbtnVer.

The issues I'm having are the following:

1. The table where the data is located only displays 10 elements (although I can click on an index below the table that jumps through every 10 elements= This is called TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:354) . I want to loop over 3500 items. In addition to that, and to make things worse, the number of elements grow everyday but backwards: every new element starts at ""PlaceHolderMain"" in 0 so the first element that was loaded months ago will be the last on the list. But let's ignore this for a moment, so say I want to loop from 1 to 3500 elements, but since it only displays 10 elements, I get an error in the loop, because it cannot find the element 11, for example. How can I loop this to ALL the elements?

2. When I put the condition: SET !SINGLESTEP YES the code seems to work fine (assuming I just want to loop 10 elements, which I AM NOT!, because of the problem aforementioned). However, this is extremely tedious, I just want to run this and get over it. But the code get stuck when it encounters the line FRAME F=1. Not a runtime error, not running out of time, it just stops! Any idea why and how it can be solved?

3. The server response is extremely slow, every step when it makes a call to the server takes about 30-40 seconds. I've tried countless times to solve this with the IT people, but it seems that I cannot expect anything much from them  Ignoring this, how can I make the script run a little bit faster? Specially the part when it fills out the form and then returns to the main table?

4. When the first loop of filling out the form I got the headers of the .csv file, not the second line that I intended. But since SET !DATASOURCE_LINE {{!LOOP}} would loop every line starting from the element 1, this mean I would have to make another loop? So DATASOURCE starts at 2 but the rows on the table will start at 1 (actually, 0)? I'm really confused right now. Any idea how to solve this? It is my understanding that I would need to create a Javascript file? but I have no idea how to do this!

If someone can give me a hand orientating me on this issues, Im more than grateful!

This morning, I tried to run it in 800 loops, but it stopped at loop 49 and gives me this error. Error: Error when communicating with the native messaging host., line: 36. Line 36 is the last line of my script. And I found that every time I got this error, I just need to change the output file name(both in script and the actual output file's name) and continue running the loop from where it stopped last time. And the script will be good for another 40 or 50 loops until this error pops up again... This is pretty confusing... Please let me know if you have any suggestions

"How to take a number, use it to select an image and use text","Hi,

In a form, the antispam works like this :

- a sentence gives a number between 1 & 5, and explains we must write the word corresponding of the image position, 1 to 5.

So for example :
Write the word corresponding of the 4th image
then we have the 5 images which are shown randomly but on the same line, in the same code, just the order changed. Even the name of the image doesn't change.
So we could have 1.gif - 3.gif - 4.gif - 2.gif - 5.gif 
The sentence ask me the 4th, so i must write the sens of the 2.gif image which could be a circle or a square.

So, how can i pick the number of the image, then use it to detect which image is at this position (1 to 5), then i extract the name of the image, in a sorte of table somewhere i stored that 1.gif is a circle, 2.gif a square, 3.gif an arrow, etc. So at the end imacro put the right answer in the field.

thank you,",3
Searching through a webpage using iMacros / Javascript,"Hey everyone,

I know many of you probably hate it when new people come here and expect to get their problems solved, but I've spent so many hours on this problem and something tells me that it can't be that difficult to solve.

What I was trying to do is something very simple: I wanted to create a macro with iMacros that is able to go through a webpage, search for a certain word and if the word is found, click on a button. Else, refresh the page and start again.

I realized that there is no easy way to use if/else on iMacros, so that I'll need to add this with Javascript. Still, my major problem is found in the macro. Basically, if I use the extract option on iMacros, it will only skim through the HTML code of the page, if I understand it correctly. This means that it will need a certain TYPE. The problem is that this webpage I am looking to skim through does update time after time but does not show these new ""results"" in the HTML code. I think it uses some kind of Javascript or php, not showing the text I want to find in the HTML code. How do I still program iMacros to simply search through the ""visible"" text on the page (in a CTRL+F kind of way)?

The macro I had implemented in my .js file that is responsible for extracting looks like this:

VERSION BUILD=8970419 RECORDER=FX
TAB T=1
SET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO
TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:*Text* EXTRACT=TXT

In this example I try and search for the word [...]Text[...] If I try and use the wildcard TYPE=* it simply does not work.

So: Is there a way to search on a page and not only the HTML code with iMacros? How would I do it?
If it doesn't work wit iMacros, is there a way to simply do it with Javascript?

Thanks in advance.",5

Edit data in CSV,"Hello! I am trying to read data from csv, then use it in webform, but after this I need to edit this data in the CSV to be sure which lines has been used. 
How can I read only certain lines from CSV file which begin only with certain symbol? And how can I edit first symbol of CSV line to tell program not to use this line again next time?

Something like that:
Code: Select all@Line1

Reading line1 => used, goto line2; 
Reading line2 => not used, use line2;
Line2 used => change line2 to @line2;
Maybe I can write this ""@ parameter"" in col1, and if col1 = ""@"" then goto next line? How can I write this in IMacros?",9

Moving forward, Progress will continue to support the iMacros product and will only provide critical fixes as needed until the EOL date. We will honor all service agreements through the existing term, except for those contracts that go beyond the EOL date. Customers with service agreements that go beyond the EOL date will be contacted separately to discuss their options and next steps.

What are your next steps? 
Please remain on the lookout for more communications from Progress in the coming months, as more information will be made readily available to assist you as you prepare your transition plans.

On behalf of Progress, thank you for your continued partnership and commitment. 

Sincerely,  
The Progress iMacros Team",2
*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

FAIL_IF_FOUND on Checkbox value,"Hi there..

I am VERY new to iMacros, and am so far very impressed.  
As I am only trialling the product at present I am using the free version. (v11)

I am using the product to create automated regression testing, and so checking results is a key element of my macros.

I am currently trying to run a macro which proves whether or not a check box on a page has been ticked.

If the checkbox is not ticked (or is ticked, whichever) I want the Macro to error (FAIL_IF_FOUND?)

I am not sure the best way to accomplish this.  I had it working using image search, but the free version does not include this feature.

How do I extract the value of a checkbox, and then fail the Macro if the value is either YES or NO?

Need to Extract Current URLs from 2 Tabs and Save to CSV,"Hi

Noob here.  I am trying to create a macro that clicks on 2 links in Tab 1 (this I have figured out) ..and saves the 2 currenturls in CSV. (this is the problem)

This is how I've thought about this:

1. Tab 1
2. Find ""First Link"" click on it
3. Tab 2
4. Grab CURRENTURL
5. Go back to Tab 1
6. Find ""Second Link"" click on it
7. Tab 3
8. Grab CURRENTURL
9. Go back to Tab 1

The end result should be 2 different URLs saved in 1 CSV file
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=8970419 RECORDER=FX
TAB T=1
TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:First<SP>Link<SP>*
TAB T=2
ADD !EXTRACT {{!URLCURRENT}}
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=* FILE=urls.csv
WAIT SECONDS=0.3
SET !EXTRACT NULL

TAB T=3
ADD !EXTRACT {{!URLCURRENT}}
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=* FILE=urls.csv
WAIT SECONDS=0.3
TAB T=1

^ This saves the url from Tab 2 TWICE in the CSV file, they should be different URLs (URL from Tab 2 and URL from Tab 3)

Any ideas?",2
Case for the Pros - Help with Looping & Excluding,"I am completely new to Imacros and I might need some help from you 

My plan is to automatically sent a message to specific users on an online marketplace.

I would like to have a script for that which allows me to execute whenever I need it.

First, go to this website: http://www.kapaza.be

Enter a search term: for example ""iphone 4""

Brings you here --> http://www.kapaza.be/nl/belgie?ca=0&l=0 ... =3&ps=&pe=

Then click on the Headline of every single result, scroll down the page and sent me message to the user by filling in: Name, E-Mail, Phone & Question. The Button to sent the message is  ""Verstuur je Bericht"" 

See here --> http://www.kapaza.be/nl/telefonie-acces ... 928109.htm

Now the tricky part comes...

1. How can I skip offers which have certain words in the Offer Headline? ( I only want to contact people who sell something and not those who are looking to buy an Iphone)
- For example words like: ""looking for"", ""Buying"" etc

2. How can I implement a function which checks if a member has already been contacted. I don麓t want to sent the same message twice to the same user. I was thinking to save every Offer Headline to an excel / csv file after the member has been contacted. If the script goes into the Offer it checks if Offer Headline is in the csv File. If yes --> skip. Maybe there麓s an easier option for this. Any help here is appreciated.

3. How can I run the script over several different pages. I don麓t want to stop if the script hits the last result on page 1.

Hope someone is able to help me with this!

Here麓s some additional info:

My problem is that the information that is extracted does not change and only appears to extract the first set of inputs out of a total of five inputs.

Captcha img changes when downloaded,"At the moment I'm trying to display a captcha in a message box so I can complete it manually then let it continue automatically, but as I progress I intend to have captchas sent to a Captcha solving site.

It there a way round this?

Selective Search and Export to CSV,"Hello Team,

Firstly, thanks a million for making iMacros. Its the best thing I found to manage my work. I will skip to the query.

Please help me with the problem I am facing. I have reviewed many (really lot of) articles on this forum but my lack of knowledge in programming makes it very tough to understand the technical jargons used, or direct info provided without any explanations on why something needs to be where.

I am sorry, I could not find/understand how to find and sort selective data from one page,, and extract into selected(dedicated) columns to manage my portfolio.
[I use firefox(45.0.1)+iMacros plugin(just installed plugin yesterday so it should be the most/latest available. I use Windows7. I am clueless on programming and hence request you to kindly help me with some comments for the iMacros script that will be shown.]

I have been trying to extract data from only 2 columns of this webpage for randomly selected stocks from this link:
https://www1.nseindia.com/live_market/d ... market.htm

Now the code starts like this:
URL GOTO=https://www1.nseindia.com/live_market/d ... market.htm
鈥?The second command below is to be sorting the table by the symbol so that I can review later easily.
TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:Symbol

{{Above, the link is first opened and then I sort the table by the Symbol (alphabetically)}}

The problem is when I make an iMarco by selecting the column in the table, it gets a POS<ID> today, and tomorrow it may change.

[For example, when I select 鈥楤HEL鈥?as shown below, I get 飪?TAG POS=124 TYPE=TD ATTR=* EXTRACT=TXT.   The problem is the POS124 keeps changing dynamically and there is no way to track them. It can happen monthly or weekly, that the POS124 becomes POS138 tomorrow for that stock.]

I am looking for a few things as listed below:
鈥?The iMacro should automatically search for the term 鈥楤HEL鈥?in the first column and then pull its value(from price column), irrespective of the POS<ID> it holds for this month/week.
鈥?If I decide to monitor 5 stocks(like shown below in red), the iMacros should automatically push the time-stamp in column1 and then populate the 5stocks鈥?values in col2/3/4/5/6.
鈥?The iMacros should run until the system time becomes 3PM. 

Please suggest what scripts need to be added.

Here is a screenshot of the 2 columns.






I would be very very grateful to have any help or suggestions on this one. 

Thank you!",2

exclude extracted data from SAVEAS based on criteria ?,"OS: Windows 8.1 64 bit
iMacros 10.0.2

Good day,

My datasource is a .csv that contains the terms I am using to search in a website. The results of searches are individual pages, depending upon the search term.

It happens that for some of the search terms there exist no individual pages and the website where I am searching shows a  ""0 items exist"" message.

iMacros still extracts data according with the its tag positioning and the DOM structure of the ""0 items exist"" page or gets #EANF# in the cases  it does not find a tag match on the page.
Then, iMacros saves the extracted that in a row of the extraction csv.


I wish to exclude from Code: Select allSAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT .csv the rows that belong to the ""0 items exist"" webpage (in other words my extracted CSV to show only the complete data extracted from the website).

Question:
 How do I prevent the rows from ""items do not exist""  to appear in the EXTRACT csv? 
What is the condition to be placed looking like?

Thank you.",5

"same elements ,different TAG POS=x across webpages. extract?","Question: How to extract data with iMacros from a website whose TAG POS=x of the same element is variable between different webpages?

Dear iMacros community,

I wish to extract data from a website that contains multiple webpages by searching in the website according to a list of keywords defined in a datasource .csv.

iMacros should enter sequentially in each individual page, grab certain elements on each webpage and save data in a csv. The elements to be extracted are the same in between all webpages.

My problem is that the TAG POS=x does not remain the same for an element when moving from webpage to webpage.

e.g on a page a HTML TAG element has TCode: Select allAG POS=95 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=* EXTRACT=TXT, while on other page same HTML TAG element changes to Code: Select allTAG POS=96 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=* EXTRACT=TXT
The only possibility I am thinking would be to pick the elements by their text attribute ( I mean their text).

Question:
Does the TXT parameter like TXT:Manufacturer (or eventually TXT:Manufacturer*) permits the selection without knowing the exact TAG POS=?

Is there other solution to make this kind of an extraction with iMacros?(variable position of the tag for the same html element across pages)

Thank you.",6

*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

Commas in Text save as CSV File,"Hi All,
again, sorry for the newb questions.  I really cant find an asnwer on this one however it appears everyone has expereinced but doesnt appear to be solutions or people who answered their own post with a solution but didnt post the solution?  uuhhgg.

anyways,,,  

I am using the iMacros Browser V11.0.246.4051 to attemtp to figure any of this out.  Where I am at now is dealing with scraping a text title that has commas in it.  When it is saved as a CSV file of course it seperates out the words that has commas between them.  For example.

Precut Insulation, Door Skin Damper Kit, Inner

I need this in one column in the CSV File NOT three colums.

There has got to be a way around this?  can someone share a solution how to either eliminate the commas in the text or get iMacros to ignore the commas in the text when saving as CSV file.

Yes I know its comma deliminted,,, if I could change that?  wouldnt know where that option is to change the dleiminters?  even if that is possible?  would it make a difference exporting text to a database?  is that more difficult?   I would think this would be a real common problem and that there would be simple soljutions all over?  any help would be appreciated.  thanks...",2

Can't save format,"I am using Windows and tried this macro on Chrome, FF and IE. 
I downloaded iM last night so it's a new version. 

iM changes the source code when I do a 'SAVEAS', compared to when I manually do a 'file' -> 'saveas' -> 'web page html only' in Firefox. It's definitely different. 

How can I make the iMacros 'saveas' be the same as my manual FF save?

My iMacros code is:

URL GOTO=http://www.webpage
SAVEAS TYPE=HTM FOLDER=C:\xampp\htdocs FILE=name.htm",3
Extracting Page Source Information If Present,"VERSION BUILD=8961227 RECORDER=FX
Windows 8.1 Firefox 44.0

Okay, please forgive me for what may end up being very novice questions. I am fairly new to trying to use iMacros. Added it to Chrome a couple years ago but never really tried using it. I just added it to Firefox and am trying to find out if it can even do what I want it to do.

I am trying to use iMacros to search the page HTML source for a specific string. If that string exists I would like for it to extract that string along with the following 60 characters and date and time to append it to a CSV file. The thing is, that string could appear in the source 1 time, 20 times or perhaps not at all. I would then want the macro to wait 10 minutes, refresh the page and do the search all over again. I am looking for what may be subtle differences in if the string is found or not. Though I can determine the differences by analyzing the CSV file later. 

I am successfully able to search the page source with the below code. I have been able to get it to display a popup when the string is found. The problem is that it times out when the string is not found and the loop ends. Also, it is only prompting that the string exists. It is not logging that the string exists in a file for later analysis. I am also only able to extract the exact string, not the following 60 characters.

PROMPT {{!EXTRACT}}

I hope that I provided enough information for someone to be able to answer my question. I guess I want to know if this is even something that iMacros is capable of doing before I put a lot of time in to working through it to only find out it isn't possible. My knowledge of iMacros and the code is very rudimentary right now, but I hope to learn a lot here and reading any resources you could point me to.

Search for a list of URLs in site and extract to file?,"I need to search my site for several old URLs so they can be updated.  Then, for each URL that's found I need to extract the page URL where it was found and the link text that's displayed.  This all needs to be written to a CSV file  for review.  I'm fairly sure the URL will only appear once on a page and there won't be multiple URLs found on a page, but I can't rule that out.  Ideally the macro could read the URLs I'm searching for from an excel or CSV file (in which case I would need the macro to list which URL was found with the other info mentioned above, but I'm willing to search them individually. I've tried checking the example macros, forums and wiki, but I'm having trouble fitting it all together (haven't used iMacros in a loooong time).

CAN I EXTRACT CLASS TYPE?

I don't even know the words to ask or research this as I don't even know how to explain it... 

When I click on one location it may have any of the five random images... it can return any of the following:

TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=CLASS:cell<SP>image<SP>yellow_things&&TXT:  EXTRACT=HTM
TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=CLASS:cell<SP>image<SP>brown_things&&TXT:  EXTRACT=HTM

TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=CLASS:cell<SP>image<SP>blue_things&&TXT:     EXTRACT=HTM
TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=CLASS:cell<SP>image<SP>green_things&&TXT:   EXTRACT=HTM
TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=CLASS:cell<SP>image<SP>orange_things&&TXT: EXTRACT=HTM

None of which will provde me with anything to extracted accept "" EXTRACT=HTM "" which returns (yellow_things) in the return string and that could be something that I could use if I new how to regex ""?????_things"" from a long HTM string.

Example return string
<div style=""outline: 1px solid blue;"" class=""cell image green_things""></div>

Question: should I try to regex ""??????_things"" out of the HTM?
Or is there a different method to count how many green_things are on this page?

What I am trying to do... is click ten of these images and extract how many of each colour was found in the list.

Sorry for sounding so dumb.. but I don't know where to begin... can someone provide me with what terms/words/keywords to research so I will know where to start when researching?

How to determine if a button is available,"I'm working on macro (Excel VBA) that will loop through a series of vouchers in PeopleSoft Accounts Payable. After the macro ""saves"" the voucher, it will click on the ""Next in List"" button. This works fine.

The vendor has over 5,000 vouchers. In PeopleSoft AP, only 300 records can be displayed at a time. 

What I want to do is validate the ""Next in List"" button to see if it is grayed out (and not available). If it is grayed out, then I will perform some other action to display the next 300 records.

Is this possible? Can iMacros determine if a button is ""available"" or not?

How to increment a variable when controlled by loop (SOLVED),"Hi,
How do I increment a variable by 1, starting with 1, when controlled via a loop?

I have 15 records per page (100 pages) I want to extract, via a loop.

I want a save a record number for each record:  1,2,3 ....1500.

If I  Code: Select allSET !VAR1 EVAL(""{{!LOOP}}*{{!VAR5}}"") at the end of the loop, and add 1 to VAR1 after each extraction, that works, except Record#1 is blank and Record#2 is 1

Is there a way to initially set a variable to 1 not 0?

Or is there another way to increment a loop controlled variable, so the first value is 1.

I've tried to record the macro in different ways but everytime when I run the macro, it doesn't find the ""Google Docs"" item or ""Ok"" that appears only if I click on Download button.

Error:
RuntimeError: element DIV specified by TXT:Google<SP>Docs was not found, line 5 (Error code: -921)

Basic Request - Can't find answer - Extract Data From Pages,"Hi all,

I'm sure this has been discussed before and will be more than happy to go over an older thread but I couldn't find anything matching what i want.  I'm looking to basically go over a directory that has multiple pages in it. I'd like to extract multiple values from pages that look like sheets including different values and have it loop through the pages one by one and extract all the info.  Can someone please help?

Page not opening,"Hello

I have macros working successfully with two different websites but am having a problem with a third.
When recording the website responds as expected, but when I run the macro it doesn't carry out a page opening.
Obviously it then fails on the next line.
I have removed the remainder of the macro below the fail line, and when this is run it says it has completed successfully, but the last event hasn't happened.
I'm using IE11 and the recording is:

The last line doesn't open the page containing the customer information. During recording when the element is clicked it is highlighted green and the page opens, but during play it is outlined but not highlighted and nothing happens.
Right clicking on the page doesn't offer an Inspect Element option, but using the F12 pointer the element is highlighted as:

Hello,
I am looking for a way to loop  through a dropdown menu and each time, select one item, do a task afterwards and then select the next item, do the same task and so on, until all items were selected.
I searched the forum and found this:
The best approach would be to loop until you get #EANF#, meaning that there are no further entries to be extracted.


I do not really know how to realize this as iim.

We will honor all service agreements through the existing term, except for those contracts that go beyond the EOL date. Customers with service agreements that go beyond the EOL date will be contacted separately to discuss their options and next steps. We will continue to offer service agreement renewals that do not exceed the EOL date. 

What are your next steps? 
Please remain on the lookout for more communications from Progress in the coming months, as more information will be made readily available to assist you as you prepare your transition plans.

On behalf of Progress, thank you for your continued partnership and commitment. 

Sincerely,  
The Progress iMacros Team",2
*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

Now here are the problems i have with this script. 
FIrst of all the CSV file contains no formatting. There is no separation between the records making them much harder to analyze.
And the second problem is that each page in Yellowpages contains 30 records and I can only TAG 20 POS. After I get to 20 POSi get the following error Automatic POS detection failed (POS > 20). please try to specify the element further.

my questions are the following.
How can I make the macro format the CSV file so that I have one value in each line.
And is there any way aroun the 20 POS limitation.

Write data keeping column headings and order from datasource,"Hi
My iMacros works like a charme only for one given datasource file, but i want to rework the imacros to work with different datasource files.
Each of my datasource files has different amount and headings of columns: the one could have
Code: Select allberlin,hamburg
url1,url2 
another one could have
Code: Select allhamburg,munich,cologne
url3,url4,url5

The first question is:
 - How can i set the column amount of the datasource file dynamically, so i'm not forced to set up an exact amount like SET !DATASOURCE_COLUMNS 1? I want just say: imacros, take all data from the first column, than from the next, and then from the last one.

Then i do some extractions from given websites (which are in datasource files) and save extractings in another csv.
The second question is:
 - How is it possible to write data, like it is in the datasource: column headings, and the extractions?",1
Extraction to String in Visual Basic???,"In Visual Basic:

Ext reads:  Whats 6x4?[Extract]
A reads nothing, I'm expecting it to read 24

SOLVED: Decode URL entities on extraction,"Hi
My iMacro takes URLs from a csv file, loads them into browser one by one, searchs a HTML element with defined CSS class and, on finding, extracts the content of the HTML element as HTML source code. Then it saves the extracted code together with the URL, where the finding originates from, into created csv file.

The problem is, that if i open extraction csv file in Excel or code editor, all extracted URLs are with encoded entities, like http_s://www.google.de/search?q=[b]g%C3%83%C2%BC ... bernachten[/b] . But i need to have decoded entities in the extracted URLs. Beside of this, it seems, like the csv file, created by iMacros, wouldn't be in UTF-8: i guess so, because after i decoded extracted URLs in the csv file with a VBA script directly in Excel, some entities, like space, were correctly decoded, but entities like german characters 眉枚盲, are broken like http_s://www.google.de/search?q=g脙茠脗录nstig 脙茠脗录bernachten

I was thinking about something like
Code: Select allSET !VAR2 decodeURIComponent ({{!URLCURRENT}}) 
ADD !EXTRACT {{!VAR2}}
or
Code: Select allSET !VAR2 unescape ({{!URLCURRENT}}) 
ADD !EXTRACT {{!VAR2}}
but this with some certainty don't work.
Would somebody point me to (quick and dirty) solution? 
thanks!

SOLVED: 
Code: Select allSET !EXTRACT {{!URLCURRENT}}

Splitting Text after a Comma and Extracting emails,"I am attempting to extra information from a large database of contacts in a format similar to this.

      Person: Dan Chilocoat, Manager
      Company: Reed & Thomas Electrical Contractors, Inc
      Contact details: (410) 239-9680, 1232 Ocean Drive, San Francisco, CA, dan@dantheman.org

I would like my iMacro script to do the following:
1. Grab the first and last name of the person and stop collecting after the comma, and place the name in one column of a csv file
2. If there is an email address under Contact details, place it in a second column next to the name. Otherwise skip to the next entry.
3. The position and order of these elements may change. Is there a way to tell iMacro to just grab the text after ""Person:"" and ""Contact details:"" ?

Here's what I have written so far:

The code does not work. Specifically, iMacro ignores the split function I set up and returns TypeError: ""EXTRACT"".match(...) is null, line 8 (Error code: -1001) for the second part of the code.

Extract (horrible) paged table with AJAX using Javascript,"This is not a question topic, I just would like to share the solution I used to extract info from a page using iMacro FF plugin.
First - iMacro is a fantastic product! I don't need the paid suite so far but I ordered my company to buy it because I will need it sooner or later and it totally worths every penny.
Second - the amount of information in the forum, the tech support and the examples are also fantastic! I built a solution in 2 days from scratch by reading everyone's else issues and solution. That's why I want to share mine, hope it can help others.

The issue: I have to extract to csv all the entries from this website - https://www.compras.rj.gov.br/publico/ (which only works on IE - blergh!)
If you click on the right table on ""10775 concluidas"" it will show a table on the center with the 10775 Licitacoes I have to extract info from.

I used the User Agent Switcher add-on for FF (https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-br/firefo ... -switcher/) to pretend I was in IE. A great add-on, by the way. For some reason in my experience iMacro works better with FF than Chrome or IE, and it has the built-in support for scripting using javascript. So, FF is the way.

The information is based on a paged table with 10 entries per page. I need some info that is showed when I click on each link. The page was designed using Ajax and javascript, so when you click the link it shows the information I need on the same page and div. This wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that when you click the ""Retornar"" button on the bottom of each detailed page to go back to the previous page with the 10 entries, it always goes to the very FIRST 10 entries. Horrible! I would have to navigate to the correct page each time I finished my 10 entries extraction. I was able to build a solution like that looping through JS and iMacro, but it would take around 20 days with more than 10,000 entries. Not sure if the reason for that is clear, one would have to test th page to better understand. For example, I started in the page 1 (1-10 entries) and extract the 10 entries as desired. Then I increment a variable (k) to run a 'pagechange' iMacro so I could get to the page 2 (11-20 entries). Issue is - when I click the ""Retornar"" button from the detailed entry 11, it does not takes me to Page 2, it takes me to Page 1! So, for instnce, in page 500, after I extract the details from entry 501, the ""Retornar"" button would take me again to page 1 and I would have to run the iMacro 'pagechange' 500 times to get to entry 502...hope the issue is clear.

As I said I developed a first solution using this option that would take 20 days. I will share if someone wants because it can be useful for some loop with JS learning:    
Code: Select allvar macro;
macro =""CODE:"";

macro +=""SET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO""+""\n"";

///Primeiro item da tabela
macro +=""TAG POS={{i}} TYPE=A ATTR=ONCLICK:javascript:ajaxIncludeDiv('licitacao_detalhe.asp?retorno=licitacoes_concluidas.asp&id=*','principal');&&HREF:javascript:void(0);""+""\n"";

macro +=""WAIT SECONDS=2""+""\n"";

var k=0;
for (var j=1;j<1078;j++) { ///loop pelo numero de paginas
	for (var i=1;i<20;i++)	{ ///loop pelo numero de registros da tabela de cada pagina
			if (k>0) { ///ajusta a paginacao porque o codigo sempre retorna para a primeira pagina
				for (var p=0;p<k;p++) { ///vai para a pagina da vez
					iimPlay(""pagechange"");
				}
			}
		iimSet(""i"",i)
		iimPlay(macro)
		i = i+1
			if (i==20) {
				k++;
		}
	}
}


The final solution: I used the Firebug add-on to find out how the paging was being handled. It turns out to be a javascript function with 3 parameters. Then I used the command URL GOTO in iMacro to go to the correct page each time I needed, using a variable to loop through the top entry of each page. Below is the final solution, not sure if there's an easier or more straigth forward solution for this site. I know this one is working great and I hope it can be useful for someone with similar pages to scrape. In the end I successfully scraped the 10775 in a couple of hours.
Code: Select allvar macro;
macro =""CODE:"";

macro +=""SET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO""+""\n"";
macro +=""URL GOTO=javascript:paginacao('licitacoes_concluidas.asp','principal',{{k}})()""+""\n"";
macro +=""WAIT SECONDS=5""+""\n"";

macro +=""TAG POS={{i}} TYPE=A ATTR=ONCLICK:javascript:ajaxIncludeDiv('licitacao_detalhe.asp?retorno=licitacoes_concluidas.asp&id=*','principal');&&HREF:javascript:void(0);""+""\n"";

macro +=""WAIT SECONDS=3""+""\n"";


var k=0;
for (var j=1;j<1078;j++) { ///loop pelo numero de paginas
	for (var i=1;i<20;i++)	{ ///loop pelo numero de registros da tabela de cada pagina
                iimSet(""k"",k)
		iimSet(""i"",i)
		iimPlay(macro)
		i = i+1
			if (i==20) {
				k=k+10;
		}
	}
}



I also did a rewing solution to scrape from the start to end, so I could finish it sooner. The rewind starts k with 10760 to go to the last page with 10 entries and the subtracts 10 on each loop:
Code: Select allvar macro;
macro =""CODE:"";

macro +=""SET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO""+""\n"";
macro +=""URL GOTO=javascript:paginacao('licitacoes_concluidas.asp','principal',{{k}})()""+""\n"";

///Salva htm da tabela

///'Retorna pagina anterior
macro +=""TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:BUTTON ATTR=ONCLICK:javascript:ajaxIncludeDiv('licitacoes_concluidas.asp','principal');&&CLASS:botao&&TYPE:button&&VALUE:<<<SP>Retornar""+""\n"";
macro +=""WAIT SECONDS=3""+""\n"";


var k=10760;
for (var j=1;j<1078;j++) { ///loop pelo numero de paginas
	for (var i=1;i<20;i++)	{ ///loop pelo numero de registros da tabela de cada pagina
                iimSet(""k"",k)
		iimSet(""i"",i)
		iimPlay(macro)
		i = i+1
			if (i==20) {
				k=k-10;
		}
	}
}



And, of course, the 'pagechange' macro from the first solution, not in use in the final solution anymore:

*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

"Data Extract of 10,000 queries","Hello,

This is my first time using iMAcros and would appreciate a little help. I am trying to extract dates from a website in a table, I have used the wizard to create the code below:

TAG POS=3 TYPE=DIV ATTR=CLASS:bindate EXTRACT=TXT
TAG POS=6 TYPE=DIV ATTR=CLASS:bindate EXTRACT=TXT
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=c:\liverpool FILE=liverpool_bin.csv

This looks up the page and then saves the info in the file. This is what I want it to do. The problem is I have 10,000ish seperate urls to look up and retrieve the info from. In this web address http://liverpool.gov.uk/bins-and-recycl ... mes/?UPRN=38028728 the red text is unique for each address and I have a csv file with all of the addresses in.

Is there a iMacros command that will load the csv with the addresses and look up each individual table and then save it in either the same csv as the data source or in a new csv. Ideally i don't want it to create 10,000 seperate csv files.

Thanks in advance for any help

OS - Windows 8.1 (English)
Browser - Firefox 37.0.2 / iMacros Web Browser

The demo's work okay, I'm just not sure how to do the thing I'm trying to do. So what I would like to do is extract a line of text from a TXT File located in my documents folder, and paste the info into a box located on a webpage. (if you don't know what I mean by ""box"" I mean any area you enter text into, as in the title of a thread for example)

I did have a code that used to do it for me but removed that file from iMacros. Before, the iMacros code looked something like the following :
Code: Select allSET !DATASOURCE C:\Users\RandomText\RandomText\RandomText.txt
SET !DATASOURCE_COLUMNS 1
SET !DATASOURCE_LINE {{!LOOP}}
SET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO

Then to get it to paste the line of text I would use this :
Code: Select allCONTENT={{!COL1}}

So how would I specify a location to get the data from? I've searched over the Internet but cannot seem to find a resolution for this problem. Any help is appreciated. ",6
Scraping business data of results pages,"Hi imacro-pros,

I want to scrape email addresses and URLs from search result pages. The thing is to get the data I need imacros has to klick on the first result, grab the data and go back to the results page and klick the next result. Ive been trying different approaches without any success.

here is how I started:

Then go back the the results page, click on the next result and continue extracting the data

I couldnt figure out how to jump from the first result to the second result after extracting the data of the first result.

I also tried 
TAG POS={{LOOP}} TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:*    but it didnt work

Id be very happy if somebody could help me out here.

Thanks in advance!

iMacros stopped working message,"iMacros 10.3 / IE 11 / Windows 7 / Language: English

I have a macro that uses iMacros to scrape information off of an invoice.  This macro worked in iMacros 6.9 and 9.  When we went to version 10 and 10.3, I've started encountering an issue.  The macro will go through 2, 3, 4, 5, or more invoices and a message is displayed that says ""iMacros has stopped working.  A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.  Please close the program."" A button is displayed that says ""Close the program"".  There is no other information to determine what the problem is or how to fix it.

The macro loops through a series of invoices.  After it extracts the appropriate information, the clicks on an ""X"" to close the invoice.  It them checks to see if that the application is on the correct screen.  If so, it moves to the invoice search screen and starts over.  The problem seems to occur after clicking on the ""X"" top close the invoice.

This is the code that closes the invoice (clicks on the ""X""):

IM = """"
IM = ""CODE:""
IM = IM + ""TAB T=1"" + vbNewLine
IM = IM + ""TAB CLOSEALLOTHERS"" + vbNewLine
IM = IM + ""FRAME NAME=container"" + vbNewLine
IM = IM + ""SET !TIMEOUT_STEP 5"" + vbNewLine
IM = IM + ""TAG POS=1 TYPE=BUTTON FORM=NAME:pageForm ATTR=NAME:Close"" + vbNewLine
IM = IM + ""WAIT SECONDS=2"" + vbNewLine

iret = iim1.iimPlay(IM)

I've also used the following FRAME NAMES to see if that would make a difference and it doesn't.

IM = IM + ""FRAME F=3"" + vbNewLine
IM = IM + ""FRAME NAME=*"" + vbNewLine


This is the code that moves to the invoice search screen by click on a tab in the application and selecting the appropriate option:

IM = """"
IM = ""CODE:""
IM = IM + ""TAB T=1"" + vbNewLine
IM = IM + ""TAB CLOSEALLOTHERS"" + vbNewLine
IM = IM + ""FRAME NAME=menu"" + vbNewLine

Extracting Tooltip from Onmouseover,"Hello fellow iMacros(u)sers  

So far I've had lots of fun and great success with iMacros. However I seemed to have reached my limit of programming capability with this one particular case.   

I've been trying to extract a Tooltip triggered by a mouseover event. I found the entire passage in the source code, so it's definitely exctractable right away, if anything I found out that iMacros has a feature to now trigger mouse events, but I didn't even get that far. I always hover over the respective thing on the website myself, just to see if iMacros will pick it up, but I'm not getting there.

The Code I'm trying to break, I changed the values a little bit.
(Note that whatever text I'm trying to extract appears twice, they are both the same and extracting one of them is enough for me.)
Code: Select all<td class="" c73w""><span class=""storage""><img src=""../../img/storage7.jpg"" onmouseout=""UnTip()"" onmouseover=""Tip('Text I want to extract 1 <br/>Text I want to extract 1 )"" class=""storageBar""><div class=""storageLevelDiv""><span onmouseout=""UnTip()"" onmouseover=""Tip('Text I want to extract 1 <br/>Text I want to extract 2')"" class=""storageLevel"">2.966.578</span></div></span></td>

I am trying to read the Tips basically. I know how to crop them and replace whatever I don't need, I also know how to extract the 2.966.578 part, I just can't seem to get the Tooltip. 
I've had various tries, here are my last ones, including some thing I found on the forums here and tried out. 
Code: Select all//iimPlayCode(""TAG POS=2 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:storageLevel&&ONMOUSEOVER:Tip EXTRACT=TXT"");
	//iimPlayCode(""TAG POS=1 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:onmouseover* EXTRACT=TXT"");
	//iimPlayCode(""TAG POS=7 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:c73w:storageLevel&&ONMOUSEOVER:Tip EXTRACT=TXT"");
	//iimPlayCode(""TAG POS=7 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:c73w CONTENT=EVENT:MOUSEOVER EXTRACT=TXT"");
	//iimPlayCode(""TAG POS=7 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:c73w:storageLevel&&ONMOUSEOVER:Tip EXTRACT=TXT"");


This I also found on the forums here, but building it into above TAGs always gives me an error claiming it was a wrong use of Command:Tag
Code: Select all	//CONTENT=EVENT:MOUSEOVER


I would really appreciate if anyone could help me out there, how do I extract the Tip?
Thank you for your time and help!

Beginner [HELP NEEDED],"Hello everyone...

i'm new to imacros and i'm not a developer at all. i just finished reading the iMacros command refference, but i'm needing some hints to develop some data extraction macro.

the issue that i'm frontin is that, bc i'm no developer i dont have the agility to think on every variable to use in the code. so what im asking is if can anyone help me, pointing the way? like you should read this or that. i'm not looking for completed codes. i want to get there myself in order to learn.

so, i would like to code a macro, that goes to a URL, and in that url there are several links. i need the macro to open a link at a time, and in the new page, extract the data needed. then i need it to loop until there is no more links available to enter.

i dont know if im being clear enough, but at this point any help is a blessing!

thanks in advance..

Save URL to file with parameters,"Hi,

I just started using iMacro so maybe for the experts this might be simple.
But after I checked the forum for similar issues without success I try to find help here.

So, currently I use the iMacro Addon in Firefox and start it like this

Run, %firefoxExePath% %url% %iMacro% from AHK

there the iMakro looks like this

VERSION  BUILD=7500718 RECORDER=FX

SET !VAR1 {{!URLCURRENT}}
SET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP NO
TAB T=1     
WAIT SECONDS=3
URL GOTO={{!VAR1}}
SAVEAS TYPE=HTM FOLDER=C:\Workspace\Downloads FILE=temp1.htm

That works fine, but I have some questions.

1. Is it possible to pass parameters to the macro for the folder and the file?
So I would like to do something like

SAVEAS TYPE=HTM FOLDER={{!VAR2}} FILE={{!VAR3}}

2. If the filename or foldername include spaces I recognized some problems. Is theere a way to use spaces in the parameters?

Thanks in advance!

Kind regards

Number of concurrent Browsers,"Hello all, 

I'm running iMacros from WSH and JScript.  I have manually been launching the scripts.  Each scraping script takes a long time to complete (10 hours +). In the documentation, if I remember correctly, it says that AlertFox was able to run 25 browsers concurrently with 2 gigs of Ram and an average processor.  Im not coming anywhere close to that.  

I'm running windows server 2008 R2 with 2Gb Ram and a dual core 2.44Ghz processor (AMD).  If I run 4 scripts at once, I'm at like 80 CPU usage and 60% RAM usage immediately.

Am I doing something wrong here?  What do other people acheive? Any tips on getting either of those number down?  

Thanks,

SET command not working in under JavaScript when extracting,"Hello everyone,

At the company I'm working, we're (trying) to build an authomatic data extractor but it fails and I can't see a way to solve it.
It takes out information (the latest ID which is displayed in main page in our internal web application) and we need to store that information later on a third-party website (and we are not allowed to use any API from them)

We want to use the latest ID as the source for a loop in Javascript.
Once we open our web app the information shown is the latest customer order information (ie: 32000)

When I test the macro code without JavaScript it works but if I am planning to do it this way inside a Javascript file, it comes with an error.
wrong format of SET command, line 6 (Error code: 910)

Javascript file was done in NotePad (UTF-8), right now it is stored inside iMacros\Macros Folder (Same directory as samples)

I want to do that number as a variable for the loop (which I can't use it yet because it's failing)

I know the for loop is wrong at the moment but I cannot understand why a simple line works fine when I run it as iim file and when I try to use it inside JavaScript, it fails.

I am using Firefox 35.0.1 / Windows 8.1

Sending form with POST method.,"Hello.

I have to go into a forex account statement site and get list of transactions from it.

The first screen is the login screen, when I type the account number and password, and press ""Login"" button. That's works great.

Now, I have to choose ""FromDate"" and ""ToDate"" and that's by clicking on ""Calendars"" on the screen. After that - there is a ""Generate..."" button.

There is a little Javascript code in the page source to handle the calendar controls. What I'm looking for - is to find a way to control the information sent by the POST method triggered by the ""Generate..."" Button, still - without success.

Saving TYPE=EXTRACT as CSV...with Commas?,"Hello All,

I'm new to iMacros and the forum. Let me start off by saying that this is a GREAT product and I'm glad I found out about it. I am currently working on a large data compilation project that involves scraping about 1,175 individual search queries from a particular website. Needless to say, the software is saving me a lot of time.

I've read the documentation on loading data into webforms and extracting text from the output; very straightforward. I would like, however, to further explore how manipulating and saving webpage text via `EXTRACT` and `SAVEAS` could vary. I have one particular question in mind.

Sorry if it's messy. Here's a link to the macro: https://www.dropbox.com/s/stsltfvph2zr4bn/IAPD.iim?dl=0 and the dataset I am plugging into the webform:https://www.dropbox.com/s/mmu6y13d3or9n ... s.csv?dl=0.

Basically, the extract .csv file is unable to preserve punctuation (commas) in an investment firm's name because the file is, of course, comma-separated. Here https://www.dropbox.com/s/h9ro8igxcxnfy ... t.csv?dl=0 is a link to the extract.

I need to merge this database with another and it is really really imperative that I keep the output identical to what comes out on the webpage, including punctuation, spaces, capitalization, acute accents...etc.

Has anyone been able to do this? Would setting EXTRACT to some other type of formatting potentially preserve punctuation?

Any and all advice would be greatly greatly appreciated. Thank you!",4

Important Progress iMacros Product Update,"Dear iMacros Customers and Users, 

We are writing to inform you that Progress will be officially discontinuing the Progress iMacros product, with a planned End-Of-Life date of November 30, 2023. 

What does this mean? 
Moving forward, Progress will continue to support the iMacros product and will only provide critical fixes as needed until the EOL date. We will honor all service agreements through the existing term, except for those contracts that go beyond the EOL date.

We will continue to offer service agreement renewals that do not exceed the EOL date. 

What are your next steps? 
Please remain on the lookout for more communications from Progress in the coming months, as more information will be made readily available to assist you as you prepare your transition plans. 

If you have additional questions, please email iMacrosInquiries@progress.com 

On behalf of Progress, thank you for your continued partnership and commitment. 

Sincerely,  
The Progress iMacros Team",2
*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

Thank you for helping us to help you better!",1

Download as Excel file from drop down option,"Hi,

I am not very familiar with iMacros (or even HTML), and got to know about it as an easier way (compared to writing a JavaScript code) for web scraping. I know my coding skills are very minimal, but I am very close to finding a solution to my data scraping needs using iMacros. I would really appreciate if this forum could provide a workable solution to the issue I am facing (advance apologies for technical imprecision):

First of all, I am using iMacros version 881205 with Firefox v 34.0.5 on Windows 7. I need to download data from a website such that I have to select (click on) Level A, which leads to Level B, clicking on which leads to Level C, which contains the required data (table). iMacros works perfectly for going back and forth between different levels, but I am facing trouble with saving the table, for which there is an option to download it as Excel (or PDF) from a drop down.

The actual trouble is not so much for downloading the table as Excel, as iMacros records that step as well:

TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=ID:ReportViewer_ctl05_ctl04_ctl00_ButtonLink
TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:Excel
TAB T=2
TAB T=1

(i did find a similar post http://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php? ... 742#p61655, but unfortunately it didn't provide a solution to my problem)

The problem occurs when it takes time to load the page (at Level C), the code gets stuck and shows error that TAB T = 2 does not exist. I guess this happens because when one clicks at the option to save as Excel, the browser opens a new tab (finding a way around this issue might as well solve my problem), and then closes it and returns to the original tab. 

To get over this issue, I have included WAIT SECONDS = 5 (or even a higher number) before this step, but sometimes when it takes longer than the specified number of seconds for a page to load, the whole thing just stops. Also, this is not a very efficient solution as I am making the program wait every time even when the page has loaded, and when the page actually takes time to load, this does not provide any help.

I also tried WAIT SECONDS = (10 | #DOWNLOADCOMPLETES) but it does not work. I have increased !TIMEOUT_PAGE and have SET !ERRORIGNORE YES.

The way I see it, I believe a possible solution could be to somehow avoid the TAB = 2 TAB = 1 steps altogether (?), or to write an IF condition for the code to enter TAB = 2 only when the page has loaded completely (?).

As I mentioned above, my coding skills are very limited and maybe not up to the task. So, I hope this forum can provide some solution to my problem. Also, please do tell if there is no way to go around this issue using iMacros so that I may look for some other way to scrape the data (please suggest); or, if nothing works out, will have to get on with manually downloading the data (which would be a shame i suppose ).

Sorry for the longish post (better technical understanding may have reduced the length). I really appreciate your time and effort.",3

Extracting returns empty data,"Hello, I am using iMacros on the js script.
Using Tag with Extract=txt in a loop.
The first extract is always successfull, but all the next ones are empty.
Sample code:
Code: Select all
// the {{t}} is the loop variable

iimPlay(""CODE: TAG POS={{t}} TYPE=DIV ATTR=CLASS:someclass EXTRACT=TXT"");

var s = iimGetLastExtract();

// alert(s); - this way I check the value

if (s == ""something"")
{

iimPlay(""CODE:TAG POS={{t}} TYPE=IMG ATTR=CLASS:Image&&SRC:http://image.gif""); // follow a linked image - not ""clicking"" either

//iimPlay(""CODE: SET !EXTRACT NULL""); - doesnt matter if I put it here or not, the next value always returns empty (unless I put it before first extract, then it returns correct value. Weird thing is that, the first extract gives empty data if I put it at the script beginning

iimPlay(""CODE: TAG POS={{t}} TYPE=DIV ATTR=CLASS:divclass EXTRACT=TXT"");

var s2 = iimGetLastExtract();

alert(s2); // - always empty :(

looping through two recordsources,"Hello, I'm relatively new to iMacros and javascript, but not to programming...

First off, I'm running iMacros version 8.8.2
                                Firefox version 24
                           On Windows Xp Pro Ver 5.1 with service pack 3

heres what i need to be able to do:
open my first recordsource, loop through the data(.csv file), each record is an url that i want to goto,
then, open my second recordset, loop through each record and update the first recordset, based on what i have in the second...


here is what i've got so far......

var numberOfUrls = 1001
while(true){
for(var i=1;i<numberOfUrls;i++){
var macro = ""CODE: ""
macro+= ""SET !ERRORIGNORE YES""+""\n""
macro+= ""SET !REPLAYSPEED fast""+""\n""
macro+= ""SET !TIMEOUT_STEP 1""+""\n""
macro+= ""SET !DATASOURCE Grp1000USA.csv""+""\n""
macro+= ""SET !LOOP ""+i+""\n""
macro+= ""SET !DATASOURCE_LINE {{!LOOP}}""+""\n""
macro+= ""URL GOTO={{!COL1}}""+""\n""

the above works fine I can go to the url in column 1 and even manipulate the data there. 
But, what I need to be able to do is now open a second recordset and loop though all the records(1 per line) and update the first url, with col2 from the second recourd source
Heres my first problem, I cant seem to pass the value of !COL2 from the macro to the script

macro+= ""!VAR1={{!COL2}}""+""\n""	

iimPlay(macro)

//mycode =!VAR1

mycode=iimGetLastExtract()

window.alert(mycode)


	Then here instead of adding a single piece of data then looping on through the original first datasource, I need to be able to loop through the second data source and update each record in first datasource with any info in the COL i need to use


//macro+= ""TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:mytext""+""\n""
//macro+= ""TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=ACTION:group.php ATTR=NAME:myname CONTENT={{!VAR1}}""+""\n""
//macro+= ""TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:SUBMIT FORM=ACTION:group.php ATTR=NAME:action&&VALUE:Invite""+""\n""

I'm trying to automate a search of the website cablemover.com to check a list of addresses to see when service becomes available for them.  The problem is that when I fill in the address and zipcode and click the ""See offers"" button it pops up a frame with a seemingly random name that has a ""loading"" type of picture, then the results frame after that.

What I'd like to be able to do is pass {{address}} and {{zipcode}} to a simple scraping macro to tell me if any results show up and what they are if any.  The problem is that I can't seem to figure out how to anticipate where to look for the results because of the frames.

Any suggestions?

I'm trying to extract data from pages like this.

The Problem I'm having is that each individual bullet point is extracting to its own separate row.

I want them to extract to a single column if possible, if not possible, multiple columns will work. 

As it is now the UL is messing up the rest of my extracted csv.

I haven't used li because the number of items changes depending on the page, and I'm still ignorant of some of the intermediate features like relative positioning, in addition there were no additional attributes I saw I could use after inspection of the source page and the element in particular using firefox or imacros browser.

I can see now though that when I inspect the element using IE I see <li abp=""1018>Fitness Center</li> etc. Maybe I could use that abp to get this taken care of.

Any help on this matter would be appreciated.

I'm doing most of this using Imacros browser but I can use Firefox or IE if I need to.

I hope I have made sense and that the provided example page helps. I appreciate the help I receive, and if I can provide more information let me know!

Loop through dynamically created pages (bttn click + scrape),"Dear all,

I have been recently started using iMacros for scraping webpages dynamically created.

The following code works for the first table I am interested in. What it does is to:
(1) click two buttons;
(2) extract the table
Code: Select all
VERSION BUILD=10022823
TAB T=1
URL GOTO=http://admitere.edu.ro/2010/staticRepI/j/
SIZE X=872 Y=527
WAIT SECONDS=0.5

FRAME NAME=judete
TAG POS=1 TYPE=TABLE ATTR=CLASS:*mainTable* EXTRACT=TXT
WAIT SECONDS=0.5

'Save as csv
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=* FILE=table_1.csv



So far so good. Now what I would like to do is to click a third button (""button 3"") that would - again dynamically - create the next table, and scrape it. 
To this aim, I tried to add the following lines of code to the previous ones:
Code: Select all'Click ""button 3""
DS CMD=CLICK X=312 Y=172 CONTENT=
WAIT SECONDS=3

'Scrape table 2
FRAME NAME=judete
TAG POS=1 TYPE=TABLE ATTR=CLASS:*mainTable* EXTRACT=TXT
WAIT SECONDS=0.5

But unfortunately the first table is not updated as button 3 is not clicked (i.e. I scrape, again, the first table).
The strange thing is that if I repeat all the above passages without extracting the first table, then ""button 3"" is correctly clicked and the second table is scraped as expected:
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=10022823
TAB T=1
URL GOTO=http://admitere.edu.ro/2010/staticRepI/j/
SIZE X=872 Y=527
WAIT SECONDS=0.5

'Click ""button 1""
DS CMD=CLICK X=223 Y=314 CONTENT=
WAIT SECONDS=0.5
'Click ""button 2""
DS CMD=CLICK X=421 Y=259 CONTENT=
WAIT SECONDS=0
'Click ""button 3""
DS CMD=CLICK X=312 Y=172 CONTENT=
WAIT SECONDS=3

'Scrape table 2
FRAME NAME=judete
TAG POS=1 TYPE=TABLE ATTR=CLASS:*mainTable* EXTRACT=TXT
WAIT SECONDS=0.5

'Save as csv
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=* FILE=table_1.csv


In other words, the previous code clicks the three buttons and scrapes the second table, but if I try to scrape also the first one (before clicking button 3) then button 3 is not clicked so that table 2 is not scraped.

Could anyone explain to me the reason of what's happening? I am clearly missing some basic crucial step here.. 
Maybe the reason is that I cannot extract more than element at time? (meaning that I have to embed the code in a, e.g., VB loop script)

My final goal is to scrape the first, say, 10 tables.
That is, ideally I would like to keep clicking button 3 and scraping tables by implementing a loop.
Thank you very much for any suggestions.",6

If I click any of the button on the box IE pops once download is over, suggesting me to Open the file, the folder, or just cancel, the macro will go on.

As with many of the websites I use I cannot reveal the login data or source.

I'm trying to download a PDF, but of course these is no link to the PDF, and it appears that there is no way to get the URL of the PDF because the link seems to be dynamically generated.

I would think this was a somewhat common issue.

I read the thread found here: http://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=2355

It basically says you might automate the download by preventing the browser from opening the PDF. But after attempting to follow the instructions (they are somewhat outdated), and researching on my own how to disable a PDF from opening in a browser, the pesky PDF still loads in the browser.

Has anyone figured out how to deal with this problem or similar? Thanks for your time.

If I could get just automate key strokes I could simply Ctrl+Shift+S to save the pdf from the browser, but that is not supported is it?

Thanks for your time.",6

Problem with encoding when using SAVEAS command,"I am using iMacros 8 and Internet Explorer 9.

I have a macro that downloads trademark data from the Belarus trademark office website. Each fetched trademark is saved as a complete web page and all downloaded marks are post processed by an other program to extract all relevant trademark data.

Recently the site lay-out was changed: the previous version of the page contained the header <META content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=Content-Type> which resulted automaticaly in a saved html file of type U8-DOS where all Cyrillic characters where maintained.
The new version now contains the header <META content=""text/html; charset=windows-1251"" http-equiv=Content-Type> which results in a saved file of type DOS where all Cyrillic characters are malformed.
When saving the page manually with Internet Explorer you can switch the encoding from Cyrillic (Windows) to Unicode (UTF-8) to resolve this problem.

The macro keeps returning #EANF# when trying to extract text or html from a website ... it's not an issue with my macro as the included extract demo also keeps giving the #EANF#.
We have another system, also running windows 7 with the exact same version of IE 8 and also latest version of the imacros IE plugin (downloaded from this site a couple days ago) ... and on that system it works without a problem.

Does anybody have any idea what could cause this?
Could it be a certain security setting in IE that prevents the imacros IE plugin from extracting data?

Thanks in advance ",1

Need help with loop for js,"Hi.
Iam from Germany, so sorry for my bad english. 
On a website, i want to click 50 links. After each click extract a few values, go back, and klick the next one.

The first macro is this (erbuy.iim) :
Code: Select allSET !ERRORIGNORE YES
SET !EXTRACT_TEST_POPUP no
SET !VAR1 {{!LOOP}}
ADD !VAR1 

TAG POS={{!VAR1}} TYPE=A ATTR=CLASS:productConversion*

SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=C:\Dokumente<SP>und<SP>Einstellungen\blub\Desktop\Macros\ FILE=erbuy-auslesen.csv
BACK

When i set up the repetitions on firefox to 50, it works fine.
Than the next macor should start (erbuy-weiter.iim) :
Code: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:weiter

I create a js file (erbuy-java.js)
Code: Select alliimPlay(""\erbuy.iim""); 
iimPlay(""\erbuy-weiter.iim""); 

It works, but because the first script starts every time at the beginning, it only extracted TAG POS=1.
So i tried something like this ( a part of the code )
Code: Select allvar jsNewLine=""\n""
var MyMacroCode

MyMacroCode = ""CODE:""
MyMacroCode = MyMacroCode+""SET !VAR1 {{!LOOP}}"" + jsNewLine
MyMacroCode = MyMacroCode+""ADD !VAR1 "" + jsNewLine
MyMacroCode = MyMacroCode+""TAG POS={{!VAR1}} TYPE=A ATTR=CLASS:productConversion*"" + jsNewLine
iimPlay(MyMacroCode)
 

That doesent work. I think i have read that js can not handle commands with {{!}}.

Now i dont know what to do next. Hope anyone can help me to find a solution.",4

Is there a way to dump also the #EANF# when tags not found i,"Hi,

I am facing this issue in version 7 imacro not in 6.

When I am trying extract few tags from a website, I see that #EANF# is not saved in the output file when tags are not found. This was not the case in earlier version.

This is breaking the column definition that is built into my automation. Number of values in a row keeps changing based on the tags found. But what I need is to have #EANF# for non found tags so that my columns in the output file are fixed and known.

Is there a way to dump also the #EANF# when tags not found in version 7? 
Your help is greatly appreciated.

Important Progress iMacros Product Update,"Dear iMacros Customers and Users, 

We are writing to inform you that Progress will be officially discontinuing the Progress iMacros product, with a planned End-Of-Life date of November 30, 2023. 

What does this mean? 
Moving forward, Progress will continue to support the iMacros product and will only provide critical fixes as needed until the EOL date. We will honor all service agreements through the existing term, except for those contracts that go beyond the EOL date. Customers with service agreements that go beyond the EOL date will be contacted separately to discuss their options and next steps. We will continue to offer service agreement renewals that do not exceed the EOL date. 

What are your next steps? 
Please remain on the lookout for more communications from Progress in the coming months, as more information will be made readily available to assist you as you prepare your transition plans. 

If you have additional questions, please email iMacrosInquiries@progress.com 

On behalf of Progress, thank you for your continued partnership and commitment. 

Sincerely,  
The Progress iMacros Team",2
*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

How to extract the downloadable CSV-files from Google Trends,"Dear Community,

I am new to iMacro and did not find any helpful topics existing so far that could help me with my problem: For a research project we need to extract the CSV-Files that are available at Google Trends (www.google.com/trends/explore) for each combination of country and search term about a hundred times. I recorded the downloading process (you need to be logged in to gmail to download the CSV-files) with iMacros and chose the option ""open file"" (otherwise it will just rewrite the file every single time, because every CSV-file has the same name and I do not know how to rename it during iMacro's downloading process). However, when I replay the Macro I recorded, nothing happens. The macro gets stuck whenever it arrives at the first ONDOWNLOAD command. The error name is the following: ""RuntimeError: ONDOWNLOAD command was used but no download occurred. (Error code: -804)"".

Does anyone know how it is possible to download the CSV-files from the Google Trends website and then either open or save it?

Thanks a lot in advance for your help

First of all, these are my configs:

1. What version of iMacros are you using

Windows 7 Professional, Service Pack 1 - Portuguese (Brazil)

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Firefox 30.0

Well, I am new iMacros user, so I don't know much more than simple tasks, which iMacro offers. What I need to do, is run a macro to extract the price value of all airplane tickets from a research in a specific website and paste into excel.
Let me explain better, this is the website which I need to extract values: (It is located at the right column)

http://www.decolar.com/shop/flights/res ... 8-31/1/0/0

Then I need to paste these values into an excel column.

It is possible to do this? Beucase there will be days, which has 10 values, and days which has 7 values.

Anchor Point Problem,"I have been impressed with IMacros, and have written a couple of macros that work very well.  My problem is that I appear to have an anchor point problem that results in me getting the subsequent EXTRACT - not the one I am expecting.  The relevant information is as follows:

VERSION BUILD=8820413 RECORDER=FX
TAB T=1
URL GOTO=http://www.sunwinecritic.com/
SET !LOOP 1
TAG POS={{!LOOP}} TYPE=DIV ATTR=ID:result
TAG POS=R1 TYPE=A ATTR=HREF:* EXTRACT=HREF
PROMPT ""Loop {{!Loop}} : {{!EXTRACT}}""

Each wine entry starts with the following:

<div id=""result"">
<a href=""http://www.sunwinecritic.com/wines/50th ... gris-2013/"" onclick=""OpenLink(this); return false""><div id=""result-right-info-wrap""><div id=""result-right-info""></div></div></a>

<div id=""result"">
<a href=""http://www.sunwinecritic.com/wines/terr ... rino-2013/"" onclick=""OpenLink(this); return false""><div id=""result-right-info-wrap""><div id=""result-right-info""></div></div></a>

My expectation is that the above code would set the extraction point at ""result"", and the EXTRACT=HREF would pick up the immediately following URL (e.g., LOOP=1 would return ""50th parallel"" URL and LOOP 2 the ""Terravista Fandango"" link.  Unfortunately LOOP 1 returns the ""Terravista Fandango"" link and LOOP 2 returns the URL pointing to the third result.

Would appreciate any help that one could provide...

Trouble Exporting from a Website,"Hello all,

     I've been using a iMacros to scrape a web table of times entered for quite some time now. The company has redesigned their page and now I'm having a lot of trouble getting iMacros to pull the data. The site is password protected so I will try and provide as much relevant information as possible. 

The site is a .aspx site and I've included a screenshot of the page for visual reference. The source code is quite long and I've added the <div> and <table> that my data is located in to the bottom of this post. I've put the data I want to extract in bold

I have been working with iMacros for Firefox and when trying to manually use the Extract command and locate the table with the TAG POS command and TYPE=TABLE, I can't find the data. Or rather I've tried up to POS=10 and I haven't gone far enough. In order to avoid blindly picking positions, I downloaded Firefox for IE to use the Table Extraction Wizard. When I click on my table the preview window shows that it has found my data and creates the command:

TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV FORM=ID:aspnetForm ATTR=ID:ct100_cphMain_gvDaily_GridData EXTRACT=TXT

I manually added:
SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=* FILE=test.csv

When I open my test.csv file I have #EANF# 


When I enter Excel and use the Get External Data from web function, I have no trouble. I can use Excel directly but I would prefer to use iMacros for this task if possible. Please help!

Generic iMacros to fetch from multiple Websites,"Hi All,

I am newbie to iMacros but i found the tool very useful. I bought iMacros Scripting Edition some days ago.

I need your suggestion in achieving one requirement
Requirement : Need to fetch job ads from many websites
Question : Can i write a generic iMacro to fetch data from multiple websites??

I am using VBA to fetch the data and i use iimGetLastExtract() API to get the whole table that has ads. But problem i am facing here is once i fetch the data, i need to parse, but for each website i need to parse differently. In one website i got #Next# and #Newline# where Tag Element was TABLE but in other website it is DIV, where i didn't get these separators.

Please suggest me how do i carry this task.

I can't keep on recording iMacros for 1000 websites and writing each function for each website. Can i get some logic??

Hoping to get reply soon.

Thanks,

LOOP to Next Loop when error is reached?,"hello...

i am relatively new to imacros and looking to scrape some data. i have a working script but would like to make one modification to it. the basic idea of the script is that it scrapes data from the 10 results from a search page on a site, then proceeds to page two to of the results. i am using the {{!LOOP}} command to go through a list of URLs i would like to scrape. however, some search results only have 1 or two pages of results, while others have 20+ pages. 

the way the current script is written, when the tag is no longer found on the page it continues to run when i would like it to stop for the current loop and move on to the next.

so i really have a two part question.

1. is there a way to tell the script to go to the next LOOP when an error is reached? if so, how?
2. what is the best way to scrape through multiple pages of search results? right now (as you will see in the code below) i simply copy the code over again and paste it below so it runs again on page 2 of the search results. surely, there has to be a better way to do this? (i am by no means a coder, just hacked some stuff together to get it to sort of work how i want it to - so any help is appreciated!)

Extract specific URLs,"Hello everyone, I hope you're doing well and thanks for reading my post. I'm not a total newbie to iMacros,and I've created a couple of simple imacro scripts in the past. Anyway now I face a task which I find beyond the scope of my abilities. I need to scrape urls from a certain page, but I only need to scrape the ones which have not been opened before. So the ones which are not present in the history, or the ones which are blue in color and not purple. 

The first way is very difficult, as many guys I've read say that you cannot browse your history with a script because of a privacy issue. So now I've turnt my head to the second solution. I need to find a way to firstly extract the color from the text and then to decide if it should be extracted or not. 

Any ideas or suggestions?

Thanks in advance, and kind regards.",8

Export from page to web form,"Hi guys, I'm new here and just started looking into iMacros for firefox. Maybe what I am looking for is not available in this version, but if so, any help would be appreciated.

My question is, is it possible to take certain elements from one site's page (values, such as name, address, phone number, etc) and use that information to fill out a form on a different site, into their respective fields. Then go back to the first, pull up the next page with different info, but of the same type, and use it to automatically fill out the form on the second site in the same fashion.

If this is at all possible, please let me know, even if I can only do it for only one specific page to another, would be very helpful. If this functionality is not there by default but can be added, any pointers would be much appreciated. 

I appreciate your time and consideration.

If I have not able to communicate clearly, this example should show exactly what i am looking for:

page on site 123.com
(static content)

NAME:
Billy

PHONE #:
222-4444

ADDRESS:
554 W Main street

So, I want to be able to automatically export this information as follows:

page on differentsiteabc.org
(editable fields and blank by default)

NAME:
[___________] <- value 'Billy' should automatically enter here

PHONE #:
[___________] <- value '222-4444' should enter here

Hello iMacros community.  I am absolutely amped to start using this product but I am overwhelmed trying to get a few couple computing statements working.  I'm not a completely novice programmer but I use mostly R and the syntax of making these statements work is running against my expectations. 

I will show you the code I have so far (only using the direct control instead of calling elements) with comments on what I'm trying to do. I've been reading through the wiki on how to approach these statements more than a couple times and now I think its time to ask for a little guidance even though I'm starting from an early stage.

3. Enter in my case code starting from 0. and click search
4. Click the first result
5. save the whole html file
6. repeat with the case number at 1,2, ...

Q1. How can I click dynamic links like I do in step 2 without using direct screen? (I found something on this under X/Y at http://wiki.imacros.net/First_Steps but I need a little more guidance as someone who has only finished the first half of javascript at code academy)

Q2. How can I run a ""while"" loop to conditionally only return cases that have links in step 4 (and hence, are real). 

Q3. Under Play, I can choose to either run a script or run a loop where I set the limit outside the script.  How can I set a limit to my loop within the script. 

Q4.  If I want to run multiple loops in one script with different limits how can I do this so the loop is contained within its respective code.

Follow two different paths based on condition,"I am using enterprise edition and using firefox 28.0 and am familiar with VB and java scripting.

How do I place such condition?
2ndly, I am confuse because, in IIM file, everything goes by line number; How do I define paths based on conditions? How do I tell Macro to executes this if pass and execute that if fails. I will really appreciate if any of you may give some general examples.

*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,"Post last updated: May 25, 2020.

If you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):

1. What version of iMacros are you using?
You find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.

2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)
Example: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...

3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)
Example: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...

4. Do the included demo macros work ok? 
This test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.

5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.
This test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.

6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?
If you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?

7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? 
Note: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.

8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.
This includes a detailed description of the steps you've tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!

This information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.

Additional tips when posting

* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.
For example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.

* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.
Avoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.

* Don't post the same question to more than one forum.
If you've miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post's subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.

* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.
Some of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don't put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.

* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.
Too often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.

* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings

Having Major Trouble Scraping Tables,"I am trying to rip table data from this page:

http://gametz.com/?A=MyItems&desire=wan ... mes&Next=0

I want the table of items to be extracted as either HTML or CSV, and to retain the following information in each row:
 1) ""del"" button link from second column
 2) Name of Item
 3) Platform

I have tried this many different ways - extracting the table, extracting rows, etc.  The closest I can get is a CSV file which includes the table with all the data.  However, the ""del"" link (and other links in that cell) gets extracted as plaintext and not as a link.  I have tried extracting to CSV and HTML.  When I extract to HTML the output HTML file includes everything above the table, and not just the table.

I have tried this using the Text Extraction Wizard from the demo of Pro, and despite using different outputs, none of them have given me the results needed.  Scripts are run under iMacros for Firefox 8.8.1.

Any help here is much appreciated.",4

Problem when extracting text,"Hi,

I am trying to create a macro to search a list of web pages and evaluate the text that is on them.  If a certain string of text is NOT on a given page, I need the macro to make a dinging sound.  I've been successful in getting this to work, but only for one page.  When the macro goes to the second page, and the third page, and so on, it always makes the dinging sound, whether the string of text is on the page or not.  Included below is the macro itself:

"New to Macro programming, Quick initial question","I have a basic programming background, and am willing to learn the necessary steps of writing a proper macro on my own, contingent upon the answer to this question. I'm planning on using iMacros for Firefox on Windows 7 or Mac OSX 10.6.8 (I have both available), and I'm curious if what I'm about to describe is possible.

This is the website I want to scrape for names: http://www.faseb.org/The-Directory/Sear ... ctory.aspx. I want to collect information about employees at certain organizations by running a search and selecting the link for their name. The link to THAT webpage is what holds most of the information I want. However, it's easy enough to filter by an institution name, but there is no unique URL for a page with a specific list of results. This posed a problem for my normal scraping software (outwit hub), where I used that program to write a macro that would work, if not for the fact that at the start of the execution of the macro, it loads the original page URL first (which always results in the default search page, AKA a blank page with no results). Selecting the ""search"", ""clear"" and the "">>"" buttons on the page don't load unique URLS, so makes me think that the database is just an active query or something, which makes automating using the program I have (outwit) a problem. 

Could I write a macro using iMacros for Firefox on either a Windows 7 machine or a Mac running Windows 7 or Mac OSX 10.6.8 that would allow me to extract data from a search described above while cycling through the resulting links on each page of the search? I'm sorry if this sounds a bit technically illiterate or beginnerish. Normally I would just say, ""hey why not just jump in and if I discover it's not possible a couple days in it was worth the experience"", but this is more of a time issue since I would need to have these contacts available by next week. Thank you for any help and I appreciate your patience with me!",1
Wow...Nice challenge ahead. Need help scraping a site,"Hi,

I try to scape this site: https://www.duval.realtaxdeed.com/index ... 04/09/2014

I've succesfully created a macro to scrape one property and thought about making a loop for the others (see also http://forum.imacros.net/_uploads/extract ... action.htm and then 'press next' (still need to figure out that one).

The challenge:
The second property has another POS numbers EXCEPT for the URL. That has the same POS number as the first property: 1.

I'm playing using the trail-version and have a couple of weeks left. 
Also need to know if I need the 'extended' version or could do these kind of things with the basic version.

Would love to hear some pointers for this challenge

Looking for some opensource scraping software,"I'm looking for an opensource scraper which can do (or be modified to do) this:

Parameters:
1. An array of candidate matches, e.g. ['email', 'contact', 'about'] or ['ceo', 'owner', 'founder'] etc.
2. An initial webpage to start from
3. A regular expression to match against (e.g. one for emails, or addresses)

Function: 
1. Check the page to see if the regular expression matches, and if successful, add the match to some sort of 'matches' object. 
2. Next, open any link, button, input, etc. which contains in its innerHTML or value or href (etc.) anything inside of the array of candidate matches. 
3. Repeat step 1, but do not crawl through a webpage that has already been crawled, and do not crawl through webpages that are off the initial domain.

I do not have the system resources to crawl through all the pages on a given domain, nor need one actually. Rather, I need a crawler that will only check links that seem viable given the array of candidate matches.

I don't want to re-invent the wheel and build a crawler out of scratch, but I am willing to take an opensource crawler and re-program some of it to meet my needs. I'm hoping for at least a good jumping off point.

It can be written in either PHP or javascript.",2

"Open Google Search results, extract text","Hi,

I think what I want to do is pretty simple, but I have never used iMacros for data extraction and am having some trouble. Hopefully I can explain it clearly.

What I want to do is:

1) start on a page with Google search results open
2) Click the first result
3) Copy the URL
4) Paste the URL into a CSV cell
5) Copy the text on the page
6) Paste the text into a CSV cell BESIDE THE URL CELL
7) Close the browser tab (go back to TAB 1 search results)
 Click the next result
9) Repeat steps 3-8 for all 10 results on the first search page
10) Go to the second page of results
11) Repeat entire process for this page

...and so on. So basically this macro would open every search result and save all of the text, until I stop it or there are no more results. I'm sure someone has done this, but I searched and nothing looked like what I want. Some looked 

I tried doing this myself, and I could not even get as far as opening the first search result. When I just click the result, it uses the code ATTR=TXT:[NAME OF SEARCH RESULT]. This will not work, I want it to click on the first search result no matter what the page title is, so that I can use the macro on every page.

If someone could walk me through this whole process I'd really appreciate it! I've watched a few tutorials here and there and read some threads, but most of it is addressed to someone who has some basic knowledge, and I have barely any. 

Please assume the latest version of Firefox and the latest version of iMacros - I am not currently at my home computer so I don't know the version number, but I'll install whatever version you know how to use if it means I can figure this out.",2

Any idea how to do it?",2
saving specific extracted data to a csv or txt file.,"Hi,
I'm trying to save a specific bit of text into a text file.  I originally extracted the full text then by using the EVAL function I was able to extract the exact text that I need.  Now i'm looking to save that specific extracted text to a csv or txt file.

ex:  the original text thats being scraped

Name: John Doe
Number: 123-456-7890
Name ID: 3453234

I have managed to get the piece of text i wanted say for instance the Number, by using EVAL and javascript.  but its saved as just a variable as in VAR1, and I cant figure out to get the VAR1 data to a csv file.  I hope that makes any sense and I would appreciate someone if they helped me out. take a look at the code if see if it makes a little bit more sense.  Thanks.
Code: Select allTAB T=1
TAG POS=1 TYPE=P ATTR=ID:FullProfileText EXTRACT=TXT

Adding new line to extracted CSV,"Hello - 

I am extracting data from specific cells in a table, and I'm wondering if I can force a line break in the saved .CSV file.  Example:
Code: Select all<td>date</td> <td>order number</td> <td>internal number</td> <td>purchase order number</td> <td>company name</td> <td>account number</td>
<td>date</td> <td>order number</td> <td>internal number</td> <td>purchase order number</td> <td>company name></td> <td>account number</td>
etc...

As I need everything BUT the company name, my macro looks something like this:
Code: Select allVERSION BUILD=6700624 RECORDER=FX

TAG POS=2 TYPE=TD ATTR=TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT

SAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=* FILE=orders_{{!NOW:dd-mm-yyyy_hhmmss}}.csv


The data is saved just fine, but I was wondering if there was some way to force a new line in the CSV file between the two rows (POS=6 and POS=7).  I'm currently just getting one long row of data.

I tried adding #NEWLINE# in the gap above between POS=6 and POS=7, but that just errored out - the documentation made it seem like doing so would work.

This is my first attempt at something with iMacros, and hopefully I can get it to work!

Extract table from website,"Hi.

Image recognition within a defined scope,"Hello,
I want to automate keystrokes on a virtual keyboard.
The virtual keyboard is easily recognized with the following:
IMAGECLICK POS=1 IMAGE=virtualKB.bmp CONFIDENCE=95
But things become more difficult when I try to recognize a key belonging to the keyboard.
My question:
Is it possible to conduct the recognition of a particular key by limiting  the scope of the search to the keyboard (previously recognized) in order to reduce the number of false found ?
Keys on the keyboard are randomly scattered.

"Help with NESTED LOOPS, please (Simple url changing proble","Hello I am very new to this and I was hoping that somebody might be able to help.
Essentially I need to save the content of several internet pages and I want to change the url each time after I have successfully saved a page.
Here is the code I have attempted to write

Code: Select all
    VERSION BUILD=8601111 RECORDER=FX
    TAB T=1
    SET !LOOP 2629
    'Maximum at 2647'
    URL GOTO=http://tds.hycom.org/thredds/dodsC/GLBa ... itude[1964][0:1:0],Longitude[0][{{!LOOP}}],u[0:1:104][2][1964][{{!LOOP}}],v[0:1:104][2][1964][{{!LOOP}}]
    SAVEAS TYPE=TXT FOLDER=C:\Users\itlemong\Desktop\Assessment_Data\Sep-Dec2008\1964 FILE=1964_{{!LOOP}}.xls



To explain myself better, say I want to go to the url: GOTO=http://tds.hycom.org/X.Y
where for example X would be between 100-259 and Y between 50-175
I want to open and save the page contents for X=100 and vary Y between all of its values (50-175)
then move on to X=101, do all the Y values
and so on and so forth.

Please help if you know a quick solution to my problem.",4

At the moment my script goes to site number 1, saves both elements in one file, goes to site number 2 and repeats it... so i have many files that i can't combine with Excel or something else. I tried the solution with CMD but it's not really working.

Is there a possibility to save everything in a cache and save it then at the end of my macro?",4

Using EVAL to remove spaces and rows from extracted text,"Dear all,

I would like to rise up the question of using the EVAL command for simple modifications of extracted text.

In my case when using the Code: Select allTAG POS=r2 TYPE=SPAN FORM=NAME:Main ATTR=* EXTRACT=TXT I get result in the form
Code: Select all""


the result is:

1234 Euro

thank you for searching""

I have studied the EVAL page in the wiki
but I guess because of my lack of knowledge of the java language, I am not able to understand how to ""say"" that I would like the spaces, new rows and text=""Euro"" or text=""the result is:"" or text=""thank you for searching"" to be replaced with """" (in other words I am interested in the 1234 value only).

I guess the key is in this function 
Code: Select alls.replace(\""USD\"",\""\"")

but I do not understand how to modify it to serve my needs.

Thank you in advance for your support and advise 

Kind regards,
