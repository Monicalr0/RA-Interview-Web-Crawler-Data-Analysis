"Facebook graph API: ""please reduce the amount of data you're asking for error""",https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/10f9tu4/facebook_graph_api_please_reduce_the_amount_of/,webscraping,"I know, if you're asking nicely to an API then it's not *real* scraping -- but official developer channels gave zero shits about this (figures) so mayyyybe it's worth a shot here? 

I'm working on a custom solution that gets *owned* page posts and comments for a client, for analytics reasons. Client manages some 25+ pages, of which all but one are localised versions, and one is a global page in English, which is the default to where FB users not included in all the different locales get redirected to. 

Everything is working OK (it's mostly `<page_id>/feed` and `<post_id>/comments` requests) *except for the global page*. 

When trying to access that via the /feed endpoint all I get is the **""please reduce the amount of data you're asking for""** error, regardless of *limit* set on the request or the number of fields requested. I can set that limit to *one* and still get the error, regardless of the amount of fields I'm requesting.

Where to start with webscraping ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/10agkmn/where_to_start_with_webscraping/,webscraping,"So far I only have experience with webscraping by using regex, which works nice. I googled a bit during the past days and it seems that DOM with javascript are popular. I don't know what the best way is but I like to know more about webscraping. What tutorials, books, etc.. would you recommend a newbie ?","[""I wrote several in-depth introductions in various languages:\n- [Python](https://scrapfly.io/blog/web-scraping-with-python/) (Python is recommended for web scraping as it's a very strong data language)  \n- [Javascript (NodeJS)](https://scrapfly.io/blog/web-scraping-with-nodejs/)  \n- [R](https://scrapfly.io/blog/web-scraping-with-r/)  \n- [PHP](https://scrapfly.io/blog/web-scraping-with-php-101/)  \n- [Ruby](https://scrapfly.io/blog/web-scraping-with-ruby/)\n\nThough here's a quick primer: all you need to scrape the web is a way to retrieve the web content (HTTP client or a web browser) and a way to parse it (HTML or JSON parser). Most programming languages has these two things!\n\nHTML parsing is a bit complicated, but HTML is a machine-readable format that represents a tree of elements:\n\n```html\n<head>\n  <title>hello world</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <h1>Product Name</h1>\n</body>\n```\nJust from indentation you can see the tree structure of this format and imagine how would you navigate to a particular element like `h1` -> `body->h1`.\n\n This is great for parsing as you can rely on strong, predictable structure to find the data instead of using regex where you rely on unpredictable text patterns (easy to break). To parse HTML there are 2 popular standards: \n- [CSS selectors](https://scrapfly.io/blog/parsing-html-with-css/) that's the stuff you use to select elements to apply CSS styles for (e.g. `.product>.title{color:blue}`)\n- [XPath selectors](https://scrapfly.io/blog/parsing-html-with-xpath/) similar to CSS selectors but more powerful. Were invented to parse XML documents when that was the dominant data format (compared to today's JSON)\n\nThe other hard part is blocking. HTTP is a very straight-forward protocol. You ask for something and you get it - a done deal! The challenge arises when you don't get a response because you look unusual (like a bot) or missing some parameters or tokens.\n\n---\n\nFor actual learning, it's best to pick a real practical project, but since blocking is such a daunting subject, you should probably choose a smaller target that is less likely to block. In other words, don't scrape Instagram or Google or any major scraping target for now."", 'What programming languages can you program in? Python? Java?

Is this a fair price for web scraping?,https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1097o1y/is_this_a_fair_price_for_web_scraping/,webscraping,"Hi all,

After messing around with Github and realizing I know absolutely nothing about Python, I'm thinking about commissioning someone to do a project using Python script to scrape the Jeopardy archive at [J-archive.com](https://J-archive.com) into CVS files using 6 fields (air date, round, category, value, answer and question). I wouldn't be looking to scrape the entire archive, but instead from the year 2020 to the current date. Here's a few examples of parsers that perform(ed) this job featured on Github repositories: [https://github.com/whymarrh/jeopardy-parser](https://github.com/whymarrh/jeopardy-parser)

[https://github.com/jbovee/j-archive-parser](https://github.com/jbovee/j-archive-parser)

Knowing nothing about Python, I have been unable to get those parsers to work for me, so I took to Fiverr in order to get a quote on how much it would cost to have someone do this. After chatting with the guy for a while he said he could do it and asked me what my budget was, which I found a little curious because I was assuming he was going to quote me at least some kind of rough price and then we'd go from there. When I responded that I didn't come in with a set idea for a budget and instead am looking for someone who can perform the project and give me an estimate on a price he came back with $130. When I told him to let me do some more research and think about it he immediately dropped the price to $90, which is the point where I started to get car salesman vibes.

I don't know what a fair price for a project like this is, and I'm certainly not disputing that this price may very well be fair, and obviously I want this deal to be good for both sides, but how we got to that figure made me think I better at least go to Reddit and ask.

What would you like to see in a free scraping service?,https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/108krfw/what_would_you_like_to_see_in_a_free_scraping/,webscraping,"Hello Everyone! I am running a scraping startup.

I think most services are ridiculously expensive and I would really like to give back to the community by offering a free tier that would suit most or even all personal needs.

So my question to you guys is how many requests per month would you like to see in such a service for free? Please be honest and realistic. I would love to give everyone milions of requests per month for free, but there are significant costs associated with running such an infrastructure.

What kind of features would you like such a service to have?

Currently I offer 2 main functionalities:

* Scraping API. It returns data from a target URL using proxies either purely as HTML or scraping specific fields and returning them as JSON
* Crawling. In the user panel users can configure scraping profiles to be used for different web pages with an UI that allows you to interactively click on elements of the target page to be selected for scraping. Full website crawling is configurable by creating a crawling agent which consists of list of URL patterns which should either be followed and/or scraped using an extraction profile. All this can be run as a job resulting in a JSON or CSV file with rows populated from all scraped pages.

The bottom line is I want to understand what you would like to see in a free tier of such a service and I will try my best to meet it.

Thanks for your time!","['In my case, I have a list of company names and only need the company url', 'for functionality’s I would say the same level you can find at PhantomBuster… what they have there is quite efficient', 'For non tech users a nice UI where they enter in their desired fields easily (say comments from a page), a decent number of API calls, or built in cookie deflections when needed.

Need a recommendation for good residential proxy services provider,https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/108hys9/need_a_recommendation_for_good_residential_proxy/,webscraping," 

Hi,

I'm working on a small project for personal use (nothing commercial) and I want to try residential proxies to avoid getting CAPTCHA challenges.  
I want to buy a few GB for a trusted/premium provider cause I need those proxies to work at the money time.  
I've contacted Oxylabs but they won't access my url (although my project is 100% legit).  
I also see that this kind of URLs are also banned in Smartproxy, both of the providers have an extensive list of urls that they won't serve.  
Few questions to the experienced folks here:

  
1. Can any of you recommend a legit/trusted provider which has a pay-as-you-go plan and will sell few GBs at a reasonable price (10-20 $ / GB) and doesn't have that strict compliance   
and won't let me down with low quality addresses ?  
2. What do you think of Packetstream.io ? I see a lot of complains about people that share their bandwidth getting paid for the traffic they share, but what do you think about the IPs they provide to their clients ? I'm sure they aren't on par with Oxylabs but for me as a client, will it be throwing away 50$ ?  
Thanks for your words of wisdom","['May I suggest a slightly different approach and not answer your question directly?  \n\n\nIf it is for a personal project I presume you wont generate an insane amount of traffic.\n\nYou can deploy your own residential proxy using a Raspberry Pi for example and a 4G stick + sim.  \n\n\n1.

thread-safe: a simple tool for saving local copies of your favorite Twitter threads,https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/101f7tx/threadsafe_a_simple_tool_for_saving_local_copies/,webscraping,"Hey Everyone,

Happy new year! I wanted to share a CLI tool I built for saving a local copy of any Twitter thread. It's called thread-safe and it's designed to do just that - keep your favorite threads safe on your local machine. This way you never have to worry that they might one day just disappear...

More seriously, I wanted a simple way to save threads of interest \_without\_ having to use a third-party app that needs access to my Twitter account (or vice-versa) and that forces me to reply to the thread to ""unroll"" or otherwise save a copy.

thread-safe generates an HTML file containing all of a thread's contents including each tweet's text, links, and media attachments (images and videos). This file, all attachments, and a JSON data file are saved to the local filesystem and the HTML can be used to display the thread locally in a browser at any time.

By using a dedicated directory for all generated files, thread-safe can be used to maintain a local library of saved threads that can easily be searched using standard commandline tooling like (rip)grep, fzf, fd, and any other awesome tool of your choice.

I built thread-safe because I often find myself saving links to informative threads and am interested in preserving the author's content. This is exactly the use case that thread-safe addresses: generating local copies of these single-authored, consecutive series of tweets. Notably, thread-safe intentionally does not save the comments or discussion from other users that follow.

Best web scraping api's at the moment?,https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1016j3l/best_web_scraping_apis_at_the_moment/,webscraping,"Hi, we are currently using 3 web scraping API's mostly for legacy reasons and to be able to have a variety of web scrapers for different sites.

I am finding 2 of these performing poorly and am looking for alternatives.

Currenly using:

ScraperAPI. Have a legacy cheaper plan so have kept it, but often it will return a 500 error when scapfly works every time.

ScrapingBee. Got in when the started and they were very good. Also noticing a lot of failures where scrapfly would work.

ScrapFly. Seems to work really well, but pissed they decided to double our price for our plan.

Would like to keep scrapfly and find another solution and get rid of scrapingbee and scraperapi.

ScrapingFish and Scrapeops Proxy look good.

Any recommendations?","[""If you're running a legitimate business just hire a developer.

How will ChatGPT affect web scraping?,https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/100scxg/how_will_chatgpt_affect_web_scraping/,webscraping,It’s a pretty open ended question because I just want to know the general opinions of web scrapers on ChatGPT,"['I believe that, as for all areas of software engineering, it will just reduce the Googling time at best, which may be less valuable the more experienced you are.', 'what do you mean by that? why did you union chatgpt and webscrapers? can you elaborate on this?', ""Not ChatGPT itself, but similar technologies and AI in general already has uses - mainly for unstructured data, or when you want to scrape different websites without writing a script for each - say many different ecommerce sites.\n\nAlso, GitHub Copilot (which is based on a very similar text model) is extremely useful for helping with HTML/JSON parsing code and other monotone tasks in connection with web scraping.\n\nThat said, I don't think AI will revolutionize anything here; it's just a question of a few more use cases and convenience. One possibility where things could change more may be bot detection (but those also already use AI, yet somehow, they are almost always possible to bypass).\n\nAlso I should note that while ChatGPT is a great demonstration of how advanced AI got, but it's not in itself a solution to most things, task-specific models work much better."", ""Why do ppl have such a hardon for ChatGPT?

I come to you in a time of need, since I have no idea how scraping or programming works, so I was hoping there's an easier way that I haven't found yet.  
Here's the deal: I need a way to find every post on tumblr that has a specific note. For example, if I were to reblog or like a post, my username would show up underneath and it'd say ""'username' liked this.""   
As you can imagine, there are millions of posts and going through all of their notes manually is impossible, so I figured that:  
a. Either I download the whole thing and somehow search locally on my pc, though it'd probably take a lot;  
b. Find a software that crawls the site and then apply a filter to that username to find the posts they've reacted to.  
Is this doable? Is there anyway someone could do this?  
I'm sorry if I don't make much sense, I have no experience with python and other stuff that is usually used in this sort of things. Thank you so much!",['that sounds like big task.\n\nFirst off if you want to search through all the posts the first thing you would need to do is create a database and scrape all the posts url.\n\nConsidering it has hundreds of billion of posts it can take millions of man hour just to scrape the whole database. But you can of course bypass that with some proxies.\n\nI never used tumblr before so let say it has the same format as following and followers. If you only wanted to find the posts that you were following then that would be a doable task.\n\nYou can simply use python requests to each username you follow and then copy down each posts link. After that you can go through each link and check the html source for your specific username.']

Custom shortcuts to automate access AI on your Mac,https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/10eau6v/custom_shortcuts_to_automate_access_ai_on_your_mac/,Automate," 

Hello folks,

I'm always amazed by the power of GPT-3 and Open AI.

This post is a combination of both information and promotion, so please bear with me.

I've always wanted to use AI directly on my phone and computer, without having to go to OpenAI's playground or ChatGPT in the browser.

For that, I created a tiny Mac app called Elephas. I have shared the app in this group [in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/1027x84/using_gpt3_to_automate_content_repurposing_for/) as well and got some amazing feedback from the members :)

Since then many users have asked for the ability to add custom commands in the app, that they can use to invoke AI on their computer.

So I've just shipped a feature called ""Snippets"".

With this, **now you can assign custom shortcuts to OpenAI prompts and use them in your day-to-day workflow wherever necessary.**

This is how it works -

https://reddit.com/link/10eau6v/video/401eus15ilca1/player

 There are many more such utility features that can help you get the power of AI in your daily work.

You can get the app here - [Elephas](https://elephas.app/?ref=rAutomate-snippets)

You can try it out for FREE for 7 days.

Appreciate your feedback.

Do let me know any new features that you would like to see in the app.

Thanks",[]

New Research From Google Shines Light On The Future Of Language Models ⭕,https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/10bq9gp/new_research_from_google_shines_light_on_the/,Automate,"Last year, large language models (LLM) have broken record after record. ChatGPT got to 1 million users faster than Facebook, Spotify, and Instagram did. They helped create [billion-dollar companies](https://www.marketsgermany.com/translation-tool-deepl-is-now-a-unicorn/#:~:text=Cologne%2Dbased%20artificial%20neural%20network,sources%20close%20to%20the%20company), and most notably they helped us recognize the [divine nature of ducks](https://twitter.com/drnelk/status/1598048054724423681?t=LWzI2RdbSO0CcY9zuJ-4lQ&s=08).

2023 has started and ML progress is likely to continue at a break-neck speed. This is a great time to take a look at one of the most interesting papers from last year.

Emergent Abilities in LLMs

In a recent [paper from Google Brain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07682.pdf), Jason Wei and his colleagues allowed us a peak into the future. This beautiful research showed how scaling LLMs might allow them, among other things, to:

* Become better at math
* Understand even more subtleties of human language
* reduce hallucination and answer truthfully
* ...

(See the plot on break-out performance below for a full list)

**Some Context:**

If you played around with ChatGPT or any of the other LLMs, you will likely have been as impressed as I was. However, you have probably also seen the models go off the rails here and there. The model might hallucinate gibberish, give untrue answers, or fail at performing math.

**Why does this happen?**

LLMs are commonly trained by [maximizing the likelihood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~amuham01/LING530/papers/radford2018improving.pdf) over all tokens in a body of text. Put more simply, they learn to predict the next word in a sequence of words.

Hence, if such a model learns to do any math at all, it learns it by figuring concepts present in human language (and thereby math).

Let's look at the following sentence.

""The sum of two plus two is ...""

The model figures out that the most likely missing word is ""four"".

The fact that LLMs learn this at all is mind-bending to me! However, once the math gets more complicated [LLMs begin to struggle](https://twitter.com/Richvn/status/1598714487711756288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1598714487711756288%7Ctwgr%5E478ce47357ad71a72873d1a482af5e5ff73d228f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fanalyticsindiamag.com%2Ffreaky-chatgpt-fails-that-caught-our-eyes%2F).

There are many other cases where the models fail to capture the elaborate interactions and meanings behind words. One other example is words that change their meaning with context. When the model encounters the word ""bed"", it needs to figure out from the context, if the text is talking about a ""river bed"" or a ""bed"" to sleep in.

**What they discovered:**

For smaller models, the performance on the challenging tasks outline above remains approximately random. However, the performance shoots up once a certain number of training FLOPs (a proxy for model size) is reached.

The figure below visualizes this effect on eight benchmarks. The critical number of training FLOPs is around 10\^23. The big version of GPT-3 already lies to the right of this point, but we seem to be at the beginning stages of performance increases.

&#x200B;

[Break-Out Performance At Critical Scale](https://preview.redd.it/n7svd95hv0ca1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=282b88e4c256236b65b23de9b8ac392abbb4e656)

They observed similar improvements on (few-shot) prompting strategies, such as multi-step reasoning and instruction following. If you are interested, I also encourage you to check out Jason Wei's personal blog. There he [listed a total of 137](https://www.jasonwei.net/blog/emergence) emergent abilities observable in LLMs.

Looking at the results, one could be forgiven for thinking: simply making models bigger will make them more powerful. That would only be half the story.

(Language) models are primarily scaled along three dimensions: number of parameters, amount of training compute, and dataset size. Hence, emergent abilities are likely to also occur with e.g. bigger and/or cleaner datasets.

There is [other research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) suggesting that current models, such as GPT-3, are undertrained. Therefore, scaling datasets promises to boost performance in the near-term, without using more parameters.

**So what does this mean exactly?**

This beautiful paper shines a light on the fact that our understanding of how to train these large models is still very limited. The lack of understanding is largely due to the sheer cost of training LLMs. Running the same number of experiments as people do for smaller models would cost in the hundreds of millions.

However, the results strongly hint that further scaling will continue the exhilarating performance gains of the last years.

Such exciting times to be alive!

Review of ChatGPT/AI for LinkedIn for marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/10bf7sg/review_of_chatgptai_for_linkedin_for_marketing/,Automate,"Recently, I found a Chrome extension called Engage AI. I've been using the tool for the past week or two. I wanted to share my experience with it.

The Chrome extension essentially writes comments for you for LinkedIn posts. All you have to do is copy the link of a post and paste it into the extension. The app scrapes information from the post and comments, then it generates a related comment for you using AI.

The comments generated by the extension are accurate and have perfect spelling and grammar. They sound genuine, human, and high-effort, far better than generic comments such as ""Great post"" or ""Thanks for sharing.""

Unfortunately, the comments aren’t always accurate. Occasionally, the app will generate a comment that doesn’t make much sense with the post and I need to refresh it. It’s also a shame that it’s specific for LinkedIn and no other platforms, so you’re out of luck if you don’t use LI.

It's not for everyone, but for someone like me who uses LinkedIn to build relationships with leads for my employer, it's a great help. I feel like VAs could benefit a lot from this, and anyone else trying to stay in front of your target audience on LinkedIn.

Personally, I comment on prospects' posts on a weekly basis. It can take me hours to come up with, say, twenty insightful and well-thought-out comments. With this extension, those hours are reduced to just a few minutes. I've gotten positive feedback from the comments I've made with it so far.

Overall, the app is a great time-saver and saves me the effort of needing to write a comment that makes sense in a field I’m not always familiar with. I’m already on the paid plan, but there’s a free trial if you want to test it out.

If anyone else has tried it, I would love to hear your thoughts.","[""Yeh I tried using ChatGPT recently for an article, asking it to add some stats and cite publications.

I could also then just ask for all \'banking/finance\' messages to be shown so I could then just do all of that in one go, and likewise all \'email response required\' - keep everything silo\'d if it isn\'t super important/urgent.\n\nIt would be a piece of cake to get the AI to write a response to the email (it excels at that), but writing your-industry-specific stuff would be a lot harder as the fine tuning (the little I know about it) would take a __lot__ of data and a relatively high cost. Fine tuning OpenAi\'s models is quite expensive.

Using GPT-3 to automate content repurposing for social media,https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/1027x84/using_gpt3_to_automate_content_repurposing_for/,Automate,"Hello folks,

It's crazy how versatile and powerful GPT-3 and Open AI are.

This post is a combination of both information and promotion, so please bear with me.

I got some great feedback and support from the members of this subreddit on [my last post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/z7sofx/using_gpt3_to_reply_to_automate_email_replies/) So sharing a post here again.

Many of our users had been asking for the ability to repurpose their existing blog and newsletter content into social media posts.

They are mostly busy content writers so this can be really useful to them in their day-to-day work.

So I tried a simple prompt - ""Summarize this for a tweet""

I took the content from an [OpenAI Blog](https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research/) and summarized it into a tweet.

&#x200B;

Next, I tried another prompt - ""Summarize this into a LinkedIn post""

And that worked alright as well.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6rf7k1pput9a1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a8f0d633897284bff66e55a0992afe8be800c44e

 

Finally, I tried this prompt - ""Summarize this into a Facebook post.""

These prompts worked well so I decided to integrate them into our Mac app, and the users loved it.

Here is the final demo of how it works inside my app -

&#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/1027x84/video/m8qtr6rtut9a1/player

 

It can be difficult to copy and paste the content into the playground.

If you have a Mac and want to do this more straightforward way then please try out my app [Elephas](https://elephas.app?ref=rAutomate-socialrepurpose)

I have built many such utilities into the app to help you use AI on a daily basis.

You can try it for free for 7 days.

Do share your feedback.

Hope you find it useful

Stepper motors with built-in homing sensor/permanent zero index?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/101tzgh/stepper_motors_with_builtin_homing/,Automate,"I am after a stepper motor with a built-in sensor so that I can home multiple stepper motors to the same rotational position (relative to the flattened shaft). I have previously done this with dual-shaft stepper motors with a cam and switch but that was too finicky.

I am looking for an off-the-shelf solution and looked into using the zero index of an encoder. But most stepper motors with encoders are only aligned by eye when installed so the zero index position would vary between motors.

Does anyone know of a stepper motor that has a permanent zero index machined onto the shaft or something similar?

Thanks!","['You can also buy servo motors that are controlled by step and direction.

One clarification I wanted to make is that although the encoders used in Teknic’s ClearPath servo systems each have an index pulse, these index pulses are not factory-aligned to a mechanical feature on the shaft. However, Clearpath motors do have a feature that would give you the functionality you’re looking for, albeit implemented in a different (and more flexible) way. \n     \nClearPath SDSK and SDHP motors have a homing feature called “Shaft Angle Homing” where, using the MSP configuration software, you configure the exact homing position within one mechanical revolution of the motor shaft. Then, whenever the homing routine is executed, the motor always returns to this same angular location (you can also specify the homing speed and direction).  Because this position is stored in the motor’s non-volatile memory, the value is retained even if power is removed. More information and configuration details can be found in our manual, Appendix H (scroll down to the “Shaft Angle Homing” section).  https://teknic.com/files/downloads/clearpath_user_manual.pdf\n\nI hope this helps.

If you haven't tried it, I would highly recommend checking it out.

AI is improving rapidly, and there are very few jobs that I think are safe from being automated in the future. CGP Grey actually has an excellent video on the subject [Humans Need Not Apply](https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU).

I don't think that AI will be ready to replace humans tomorrow, but I firmly believe that it will be possible within my lifetime, if not within the next 10 years.

Having said that, I don't think that our society is ready for millions of people to lose their jobs. We don't have a way to take care of or support these people.

Sadly, I think the ""human"" solution to AI will be to ban it, and guarantee that people will get to keep their jobs.

Personally, I'd like to see us move in the opposite direction. Rather than guaranteeing jobs, I'd rather see us guarantee housing, healthcare, education and maybe a Universal Basic Income?

People would have the freedom to work if they wanted to, but they wouldn't be required to. They could take care of their families, pursue higher education or pursue their passions.

I can't pretend to be an expert or to know what the best way to structure that type of society would be.

I’m looking to improve an internal process which currently consists of internal feedback being sent to someone’s email, who then has to manually enter this data into a spreadsheet.

A lot of the work I get from my clients is pretty simple, i create or I am given a hero image and I basically version it out at different sizes and add different logos and slogans to it. 

I can imagine this’ll get automated within the next 5 years but I do wonder.. Is there a way to automate this already? Like, put in the image, the campaign brief with the necessary versions needed and - bam- campaign assets are created? 

If not, do you suggest even trying to automate this? Or is that wayyy too big of a project for a beginner? Or maybe it’s just not the answer we need in the world lol

We are looking for a CRM platform that is highly customizable and has strong workflow automation. Ideally, I'd like to build a system that has ""decision tree"" functionality. An example of this would be ""If a new lead is entered into the CRM, then assign the lead to a team member and give them the task of 'call lead'."" From there, I would like almost a prompt to ask the user the following ""did the lead answer the phone?"" If the answer is yes, it would ask the user to write notes and then automatically schedule a follow-up call into their future to-do list. But, for example, if the lead did not answer, I would want the follow-up call set for an earlier date/time so that we make sure to contact the lead before it is too late. Basically, I would like to create a decision tree automation for the entire process of the business so that the system will be followed to the T every time. Does anyone have any suggestions for which CRM would be best for this? Thanks","[""You're describing HubSpot at multiple stages here.

Chatbot requirements: technical and non-technical things to consider when everyone talks about ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/zjzcsq/chatbot_requirements_technical_and_nontechnical/,Automate,"Hi there! Just want to share some tips on how to craft the right chatbot when everyone talks about ChatGPT. First of all, a custom chatbot company or any chatbot platform that does custom integration can integrate your chatbot with ChatGPT instead of Dialogflow. So yeah, you can have an outstanding customer service chatbot that can handle other topics. However, the right question is should you? 

If you want a chatbot that does solve issues, not creates more, you must start with **the proper requirements.** Well-structured chatbot requirements lay the right foundation for your future chatbot development.  ChatGPT is just one of the options of how you can use AI and automation and may be not the best depending on your budget and goals. 

**Your chatbot requirements should include these steps:** 

\- defining the main problem you want to solve with the chatbot, 

\- measuring the impact of the problem,

\- determining the main chatbot goal/objective, 

\- understanding the market and target audience 

\- paying attention to the ""internal audience"" of the chatbot (the people or the team in your company who will be working with the chatbot).

Imagine you have found a problem when analyzing customer feedback. Most customers are saying the customer service response time is very long, and that's why they are giving you a low rating.

Your objective for the chatbot could sound like this: *""Decrease waiting time to 1 minute by the end of Q3 2023""* or *""Improve customer service response time from 18 minutes to 1 minute in the next Q""*

Having done this part, you can move to the next step, drafting the technical chatbot requirements. 

When working on the tech requirements, think about the following things:

* **Channels.** Which channels do you want your chatbot to be on? [Website](https://botscrew.com/blog/how-to-build-a-website-bot/), [WhatsApp](https://botscrew.com/blog/a-step-by-step-guide-to-create-chatbot-for-whatsapp-for-business/), Facebook, [SMS](https://botscrew.com/blog/sms-chatbot-a-complete-guide-for-business-use-cases/), [Instagram](https://botscrew.com/blog/instagram-chatbot/), email, etc.
* **Languages.** Which languages do you want your chatbot to “speak”? English, French, German, Arabian, etc? Should it speak one language or multiple?
* **Integrations.** Which tools do you need the chatbot to be integrated with? CRM, payment system, calendars, maps, custom internal tool, etc.
* **Chatbot's look and tone of voice.** If you have a specific vision of the chatbot, be sure to include this in the requirements. Also, if you have a very prominent brand personality and tone of voice, include that in your requirements as well.
* **KPIs and metrics.** Be sure to specify if you have any specific [metrics and KPIs](https://botscrew.com/blog/chatbot-metrics/) you have that you want the chatbot to meet.
* **Analytics and Dashboards.** Do you want the analytics to be in real-time? Are there any specific data you want to have on your dashboard like the number of users, automation rate, etc?
* **Technologies.** Do you have any specific technologies you want the chatbot to be built with? Is ChatGPT the right one for you? What are limitations of ChatGPT? 
* **NLP and AI.** Do you want the chatbot to have decision tree logic, Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), or Artificial intelligence (AI)?
* **Accessibility.** Do you need to meet some specific accessibility requirements like WCAG or ADA?
* **Users.** How many people from your team are going to use the chatbot? How many of your customers or conversations do you expect to use the chatbot?
* **Rich media**. Should the chatbot’s responses include text, hyperlinks, images, gifs, video, and PDF attachments?
* **Security.** Do you have any specific security measures and requirements you want the vendor or the chatbot to meet?
* **Hosting.** Where the chatbot and the user data will be hosted: on your own servers or on the cloud? If on the cloud, what will be the cloud service provider and server's location?

You can consider chatbot development and decide on chatbot vendors when you have a chatbot requirements outline. Here you can find what criteria to have [when deciding between chatbot vendors](https://botscrew.com/blog/essential-chatbot-requirements/?utm_source=RedditDecember&utm_medium=&utm_campaign=&utm_term=&utm_content=).","[""Is DRIFT or any of the equivalent players integrating ChatGPT in to their products yet?

"Would anyone be willing to share details on how the UIPath pricing works? We are currently on Kofax RPA, I'd love to switch but I fear it will be much more expensive",https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/10dd3sy/would_anyone_be_willing_to_share_details_on_how/,automation,"Hey guys!

I'm the head of our department for Process Automation and one of the tools at our disposal is Kofax RPA. The business bought this in themselves (without telling IT) because a salesman sold it as fine for end users. Out of the 20 that trained, only 1 kept going and managed to DDOS the main system and so it got brought to IT's attention and came under their wing. I was then hired to work with it. I now work with this and several other systems to automate processes.

I love the ease of the software and you can spin up robots so easily. It's not cloud based, but we don't need to have any VMs because Kofax has a sort of emulated desktop where I can run excel, websites etc so we have 2 servers to run the bots as services and nothing else required. It's quick, it's easy.... but I HATE Kofax. 

There is no community, we've been asking for changes for 5 years and nothing happens. They don't offer cloud and our infrastructure if off-shored to TCS and it is always breaking down. The support is non existent. There is no training we had to learn by doing. When you ask their support or training teams, they come back going ""I don't know, we were not trained on this"". Upgrading the on prem software is week's of hard work and planning. The thing is great when it works but so flaky and not getting much investment.

I love the look of UI path but I fear it may end up waaaay more expensive. From what I've seen, you pay per month for the software but you also have to pay per month for each robot? We have 100+ processes running under Kofax and we are on their old licence - so we pay for the amoutn of ""resources"" we use at any given time. So we can run 100 robots just staggered across time so they're not all running at once. And some of the robots are big processes that can take up to a day but only go once a month, and other processes that take days but runs a couple of times a year. I can't pay per robot for a thing that rarely runs (but when it does, it enters 100s of thousands of rates into our system).

I'd love to hear from anybody willing to share a ballpark figure or even just confirm how it works for paying for robots and if I would be shelling out 1000s of dollars a year per process I automate. I will never get that past a business case!

Is ChatGPT a trap for businesses?,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/109c368/is_chatgpt_a_trap_for_businesses/,automation,"I've seen a lot of excitement from various businesses about using ChatGPT to let them reduce their staffing costs in fields like customer service. If you look at the numbers right now, it makes a lot of sense because the costs of ChatGPT are current really, really low. But the terms and conditions of ChatGPT make it very clear that those costs can change, and I wonder if businesses might be walking into something of a trap.   


There's a lot of money to be made in automation, I know, I am an industrial automation engineer. But I expect that OpenAI (the developers of ChatGPT) knew exactly how much money their software could save companies when they developed that software, which is why they did it, and they don't intend to let the companies pocket the lion's share of those savings that they did they work to realize.   


So right now, companies can be early adopters and help ChatGPT build market share, train their AI, integrate it with other software packages and demonstrate it's ability to displace workers in the real world. But companies that go down this route and going to make ChatGPT essential to their business operation. So when ChatGPT decides to 10x, 100x, 1000x their costs, those companies are going to have to pay it, and at that point they may have done a lot of work to make ChatGPT a viable alternative to a human employee only to pay OpenAI some non-trivial percentage of the pay of the human worker their displaced.","[""Not necessarily. It could be that they leave ChatGPT at low cost for small commercial consumers, and make it expensive for larger projects such as government and military contracts.

*   3 smart bulbs exist in OFFICE.

*  In Tuya Smart, I've setup the following:  
     IF office(123) OFF and PIR Motion Detected  
     THEN execute automation officeON

I created the inverse of the above so the bulbs turn off when detected as on.

I've also tapped to set ""When ALL conditions are met""

I understand why it does not work:  I've created a loop.  When I press the button, it's triggering both routines.  

The issue is I don't know how to set it up as Tuya wants me to do it.  This would be 1000x easier if the execution simply toggled the power state rather than having to make routines to check the power state. 

Another oddity is in another office, it works exactly as it should but that office only has 1 bulb.  The weird thing is I intentionally created a loop by setting PIR motion sensor to both ON and OFF state.

Looking for feedback - Users subscribing but not understanding capabilities of product,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/zzfs0a/looking_for_feedback_users_subscribing_but_not/,automation,"I built an application where users can click “record” then perform whatever actions in a browser like add data to CRM, send email, send message etc and then replace whatever value they typed in the recording with a dynamic value from google sheets. For example let’s say you want to send a bunch of users a message on Instagram and you have a list of usernames in a google sheet. You click record, go to Instagram, type in the username, type the message then click send. Then you edit this to use the value from google sheets instead of what you had actually typed.

Most of our users signed up to send automated instagram messages and have understood how that works pretty well but when wanting to automate actions on another site / in a different way it doesn't go too well.

Whatever you record can then be triggered by webhook, new row in google sheet, scheduled etc.

This is working great and we have a number of customers using it to send Instagram messages but they’re not seeing that the same idea can apply to LinkedIn, Facebook, openphone etc. without spending 10-30 minutes on a call they’re not understanding whatever action they record can be performed from a cloud service later with dynamic data so they don’t have to.

I’m a bit overly technical with explanations which is the fault for the majority of this but how would you better train users on the product without getting on 30 minute calls or building resource pages with videos that are just going unwatched

I understand a lot of these things can be done via api, with zapier etc but most users we have cannot do that and for some sites there is no api so there is no real alternative besides hiring a VA/being a developer to write a custom script/giving up your time

Text expansion app for Android - allows SQL lite files,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/zrdx60/text_expansion_app_for_android_allows_sql_lite/,automation,"Hi everyone!

I wasn't quite sure what subreddit to ask about this in so please let me know if I'm not in the right place. :)

I'm currently using a piece of freeware for text expansion and simpler macros on my PC that I'm really happy with. However, I'm unable to find an app for my Android phone that's compatible with it. The software doesn't have an official mobile app so I'm looking for any app for text automation that I can use to expand text (duh) while typing on my phone.

However, I'd like to be able to export the SQL lite database from my PC and import it into the Android app so that I have all the snippets ready to go. (I'm not expecting the macros to work or any of the shortcuts that include keyboard-specific keys like Ctrl or Alt).

I realize this won't be an automatic synch, much less a two-way synch, but it's good enough for now. :)

automated DJ software,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/zq7b83/automated_dj_software/,automation,"I made software using JavaScript that has about 300 songs and the software mixes the tempo matched instrumentals in key, each refresh creates a new endless mix and its powered by the super accurate Web Audio API hardware clock, even works on iOS.

The dopest part is that it is super flawless accurate as far as key matching and tempo matching goes and its all written in vanilla JavaScript. It even does some things DJs cant currently do, like considering the accurate tempo/pitch shifted key (like when a DJ speeds up a song) instead of the one the song is recorded at. As much fun as DJing has been to me for over 20 years, this is even more fun because it comes up with combinations I love and have never used before but they sound great together.

Previously I was an electrician before pursuing my degrees to become an engineer. Based in Ireland. 

I've always loved automation, I excelled at it in college, plc programming, logic, robotics, but I ended up going down the path of an electrical design engineer mostly since leaving college in 2018, most recently I'm also a control & Instrumentation Engineer. I've been working in proximity to automation engineers throughout some projects and really like the idea of doing the role everyday.

What I'm struggling with is how or can I break into an automation engineer role? I've looked at 100s of roles for automation and I don't see any point in applying as I don't meet the criteria but I know I'd love doing all of the responsibilities! What can I do? I can't think of anything other than completing some PLC dojo courses etc but that still doesn't give me the experience required.

Edit: going back to college full time is out of the question, I've already done this to acquire two degrees.

It all depends on if you really want to learn it. We would train PLC programming and HMI development. That's not something that people can typically get training for in school themselves in most cases.

Automating Weq4u.. via Zapier or scripts or something similar?,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/ywvzbc/automating_weq4u_via_zapier_or_scripts_or/,automation," 

We are based in the UK and use a horizon phone system.

One of our departments have to often queue for hours to talk to someone in another call centre they need, it wastes a lot of time, and they are tied up when clients need them, they dont want to put the queued call on hold to talk o a client in fear of missing when its answered.

Weq4u is an excellent free service which takes the sting out of this but with a couple of caveats.

It routes your call queue request based on caller Id so you can't have more than 1. Plus all of our agents have the outbound CID set to our main office number, so that's 1 for the whole company and the return path for that number is our reception. So it can't work from this CID

When you are at the front of the queue it gives you a quick missed call for you to redial from the relevant CID to connect, it doesn't just join in you when you answer the call.

My thoughts were that we could have separate VoIP lines (with any UK provider) for the agents just for managing weq4u, so our agent makes the call out with their unique CID, they join the outbound queue and presses 9\* to end the call, so weq4u does its magic and waits for an agent.  
Then weq4u rings back to that VoIP line (2 rings missed call) to tell it that the agent is ready on the outbound call. We have an automation somehow which immediately rejects the weq4u call based on its CID, then redials it (which you have to do), dials a hunt group (external inbound) number on our horizon system and transfers the call onto that hunt group (or conferences it if that's easier).

I could name the horizon hunt groups based on which agents queue will be calling so that everyone in that department can see that Agent X's outbound call queue is ready to talk, if they are available they will grab it, if they are away or on the phone someone else will grab it and do what's needed so it's not missed.

It's only a small department, currently only 4 but looking to expand to 8 agents, they all sit together and can easily see whos busy and whos not.

It should work in theory, but I've been trawling VoIP systems and automation systems and I can't find an obvious way to make this happen.

The system would need to have unlimited minutes, include the 0333 number in the minutes, and be able to present UK CID's

I would appreciate any pointers or ideas I'm a sys admin (and I do a bit of easy dev), I'm not up on all the VoIP solutions out there.","['Thank you for your post to /r/automation!\n     \nNew here?

Automated testing basics,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/yqjg89/automated_testing_basics/,automation,"Running a large number of tests automatically on the developer's computer, server, or in the cloud to make sure everything functions as intended.

The testing phase of the software development lifecycle is crucial. By handling tedious and repetitive duties like regression tests, automation testing frees up testers to focus on other high-quality activities like conducting exploratory tests and analyzing test findings, among other things. As a result, automation testing makes it possible for you to complete more tests faster.

Manual testing may become challenging as there are more features to test or more software faults to find. Automated testing can help with this.

To keep the software development process productive and effective, automation testing investment is crucial. You may run tests in any environment you require, as frequently as you like, and with automation. As a result, security and stability are improved, time and effort are saved, and maintenance costs are decreased.","['Thank you for your post to /r/automation!\n     \nNew here?

Benefits Of Automation Testing,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/yid2dc/benefits_of_automation_testing/,automation,"Automation testing is one of the most popular methods for software testing. It’s an extremely efficient, cost-effective solution that can be adopted at any stage of your software development lifecycle – and it eradicates ambiguity on whether to use automation testing or stick to manual testing.

Automated testing has many benefits, such as: 

**Shift-left testing**\- It is a part of continuous testing that conveys that the testing phase should be incorporated into the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle), right from the requirement gathering phase to find bugs at an early stage. This can save money and time, by ensuring that bugs are found early by a tester.

**Easy regression testing-** Developers may need to perform a set of similar test cases over and over again, just to ensure that the bug has been removed. To make sure all testers have access to the latest changes, they have to spend time setting up the environment on their local machines and then run tests in parallel by creating new test plans and test cases every time. This leads to unnecessary wastage of time, money and efforts.

**Reduced business costs-** Automation testing offers significant benefits. It is advantageous for organizations because it reduces business expenses and enhances the quality of work. With automation testing, organizations are able to reduce additional expenses and maximize resource utilization.

**Improve the quality of manual tests-** With the help of test automation tools, you can perform manual testing very effectively. Test automation helps testers validate testing coverage in different environments and produces the required results at a much faster pace. These benefits of test automation have won customer favors in recent years.

**Better smoke testing-** Smoke tests are considered to be a best practice as they help avoid outages. These tests are used in the early phases of a project, and can catch major issues before tests begin running regularly. Automated smoke tests are an efficient way for teams to do this.","['Thank you for your post to /r/automation!\n     \nNew here?

2. Support for pytest with selenium, appium, playwright tool

3. Flaky test detection logic

4. Number of tests does not impact the overall runtimes too much because cloud scales for you

General advice on setting up tests,https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/109gvcx/general_advice_on_setting_up_tests/,selenium,"Hello! I am pretty new to testing and Selenium and I feel as though I'm *not getting it*. 

I'm currently building an e-commerce portfolio app with Django; right now I have my accounts app set up to register new users, log them in/out, and delete their accounts. Presumably I'd like to test all those features in a script: load my app, create a new user, log that new user in, log them out, delete the account.

I've encountered a countless number of technical difficulties even performing one of these tasks. I've found the official documentation to be contradictory and confusing (maybe it's just me); every tutorial I've found so far has used outdated syntax and only delves into the most uselessly superficial tasks (loading a URL and that's it).

So I'd like some advice on where to go to figure out what the process is for testing what I'm aiming to test. **What's the general strategy for setting up these tests**? Are there any up-to-date resources available that focus on more useful testing processes?

For a specific example of a problem I'm encountering: how does one handle loading a different page during the test? I have been able to register a new user; on clicking ""submit,"" it takes them to a login page. How do I wait for the new login page to load before continuing? Implicitly waiting doesn't seem to do anything, but `time.sleep()` does.

Even if someone has a link to a repo that includes some tests in Python (especially if it's Django!) would be wonderful to see. I learn by example pretty well. Thanks for any advice.","['This is a hard one to answer, as there aren’t any specific problems posed.  \n\nFor the redirect to the new page, you are on the right track.  As a general rule I would be using a selenium wait on the WebElement that I was looking to use on the new page.\n\nThe general strategy may vary depending on tech used.  Currently I am using Cucumber with Selenium.  So I will write my test in Gherkin.  It’s BDD, so that fails, but with an error that tells me to implement the code.  I implement it and then write the next test.  All of my tests are independent, meaning that each test logs in, completes the test and logs out.  There is no dependency between tests.\n\nSome things you may want to look at (off the top of my head) are the selenium page object model, data injection to share your web driver, maybe a web driver factory if you are testing multiple browsers.\n\nI feel you.  The documentation you find around the web can be sparse, simple, and outdated, but it is out there.  Even what I have written here may be outdated as a newer version of Selenium has simplified the process of creating/using the webdriver.  I haven’t looked at that closely yet.']"

Python & Selenium - help / ideas,https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/102sxzq/python_selenium_help_ideas/,selenium,"Hi All,

This probably isn't the cleanest code anyone has seen but, currently I am looking for some help or even ideas.   This code I've made is a project for fun, reason why I made this is I like to travel and yes I get there are other things like Hopper and FlightTracker but wanted to try some things on my own.

&#x200B;

**Here is what the code does:** It goes to the [AA.com](https://AA.com) site > Searches for the airport I depart from and want to arrive > Enters in the travel dates > Searches for them > AA (Tells me the dates are incorrect) I tell it to hit the submit button again  and it works > Then it takes a screen shot of the  depart flight of the first half of the page, saves it in my downloads then  clicks on the first box because it is the cheapest > Then Takes a screenshot of a return flight and saves it to my download.

(I haven't put this code on reddit but if anyone wants it I can easily give it to them.)  The next steps are I have another script run a couple minutes after > Picks up the files I saved to my downloads > Attaches it to an email and then the email sends it to me)

&#x200B;

**What i'm trying to get help with is i'm trying to get rid of the old way screenshots and putting this info into an excel document, or even put text into an email with Flight number, Price, Date, Time... ETC but i've ran into a road block and i'm not even sure if this is possible. Would love some help if anyone has experience.**

>element.Click();

`def browserthread(link):`  
 `i=links.index(link)`  
 `chrome_options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()`

`drivers.clear()`

If multiple threads are run without profile specification, than all the chrome instances work fine, but when three profiles are opened in separate threads, only one instance works fine meanwhile other two remain halted.

Firstly, I've never found an element I couldn't get with xpath. Secondly, xpath allows me to navigate a DOM's hierarchy at will.

xpath breaking,https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/z3a4am/xpath_breaking/,selenium,"So, I have a python script that at some point needs to get information from a website.
Everything is fine when I try to get ellement a, but element b breaks. This element lies deeper in the html code. Nothing would work.

 I figure the website makes use of something akin to tabs, but nothing seems to reflect this in the html. (And the ""default"" tab is the one I need anyways)

If you can, try to find the element through some other means like class name, id (though I reckon you would've done that already if that was an option), text, and so on. If you can get the parent element of the element you want more easily with something like id, class name, text, etc. try to get that and then use some other means to search for the element you want within that element.\n\nFor example I had once a button that had no unique identifier to go on. The text of the button was the same as many other buttons in the DOM, it had no id, and the class names also were identical to many other buttons. I tried using XPath at first, but since the button appeared on a form that was generated when a certain event happened, the XPath wasn't always the same. However I noticed that the form actually had some unique identifiers, so when I first searched for that element with the unique locator I was then able to just look for the button element from within that form element. Even though the locators were identical to other elements on the page, they was unique within the context of the parent element.\n\nHope any of this helps!"", 'I can understand that you cannot share html code here.

How can I change the address of Chrome devTools to use a websocket instead of ip:port ? Or is there another way to do this?",[]
"Need help with making a generic Xpath within the Action (Helper location), that I can reuse on the web-application form page",https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/yfjv88/need_help_with_making_a_generic_xpath_within_the/,selenium,"Hi All,

&#x200B;

I’m new to automated testing with Selenium and have some questions regarding the following that I want to accomplish.

\-	I want to define a generic Xpath within the Action (Helper location), that I can reuse for several fields on the web-application form page.

\-	Basically I want to find the class element that I have written down in Step 2 and fill the k-textbox with a value by using the generic Xpath from Step 1.

&#x200B;

The below example is not working for me and I guess I have messed it up, would be nice If someone could provide me with an example. Thanks!

&#x200B;

Step1:

My current generic Xpath within the Action (Helper location), that I want use for several fields on the webpage form.

&#x200B;

Example what I got.

&#x200B;

public void SelectAndTypeEditFieldByLabelGeneric(string label, string searchtext)

{

TypeByXpath(""//\*\[contains(@class,'form-col') or contains(@class, 'form-input')\]//\*\[text()='"" + label + ""'\]/parent::div//input"", searchtext);

}

&#x200B;

Step 2:

From my steps location I fil in the input values with the reference toward the generic Xpath from step 1.

&#x200B;

Example what I got.

&#x200B;

\[When(@""I Fill In The Account Details"")\]

public void WhenIFillInTheAccountDetails(string label, string searchtext)

{

Action.SelectAndTypeEditFieldByLabelGeneric(""Bedrijfsnaam"", ""Test Company"");

Action.SelectAndTypeEditFieldByLabelGeneric(""Straat"", ""Test Street"");

Action.SelectAndTypeEditFieldByLabelGeneric(""Huisnummer"", ""999"");

    }  

Furthermore the When condition here has a relation with the SpecFlowFeature for the scenario.

&#x200B;

Scenario: Add A New Account

    When I Fill In The Account Detail

EDIT: I found the issue and solved the problem.

I changed: 

public void SelectAndTypeEditFieldByLabelGeneric(string label, string searchtext) With -> 'public void WhenIFillInTheAccountDetailsTest() .  

And within Action I changed the string searchtext with string value

public void SelectAndTypeEditFieldByLabelGeneric(string label, string searchtext)

{

TypeByXpath(""//\*\[contains(@class,'form-col') or contains(@class, 'form-input')\]//\*\[text()='"" + label + ""'\]/parent::div//input"", searchtext);

Website Blocking Selenium Input,https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/yf9790/website_blocking_selenium_input/,selenium,"Some background: I have been working on a project for a while now that scrapes fares off Amtrak's site so a calendar view of fares can be seen at once. Initially, Amtrak would throw an error anytime I tried to make a search on the site, but adding the code below as an argument to options fixed that.

    ""--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled""

Now, I am struggling with a much more challenging kind of error. Using the above code, I can access the site and perform searches. However, after making many consecutive searches (the number varies but around 5+), the site stops loading searches again for 10-20 minutes. What is particularly strange about this error is that Amtrak is not blocking my browser, if I manually enter the same information Selenium does through the webdriver browser the site loads fine. I have tried using the undetected\_chromedriver extension and altered my input to appear more human-like by entering phrases character by character, adding random delays between every action, and hovering over elements before clicking. Somehow, Amtrak is able to differentiate my human input from Selenium, and I have no idea how. I'd really appreciate any ideas for how to change my code to make the form input undetectable.","[""Can you share your code so far so we can try tinkle with it to find a solution, I've a few ideas in my mind already""]"

Is it possible to automate clicking a browser extension?,https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/yda3k6/is_it_possible_to_automate_clicking_a_browser/,selenium,"Hi.

I'm using Firefox on both my mobile phone and my PC and I have a tendency to open a lot of Facebook, 9gag, etc. tabs that contain videos on my mobile phone and then send the list of tabs to my PC where I open each link manually, click the VideoDownloadHelper addon on upper right, choose quality of video to download then swap over to next tab.

Is it possible to automate this with Selenium? The whole process would look like this:

1) Click VideoDownloadHelper
2) Click ""HLS streaming"" option in drowndown menu from VideoDownloadHelper with highest resolution
3) Ctrl+Tab to next tab
4) repeat until out of tabs

Dealing with div number changes,https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/ycoqtv/dealing_with_div_number_changes/,selenium,"I am currently working in a automation of a kind of web form, but the it seems that the dibs numbers of the elements changes if I tried to retest my code (which means open the browser logging in, query the form and so on...).

Any thoughts?","['The full xpath path will change 99% if it is a modern site, since new things will be added to the site and the site could update as well, making your full xpath path invalid.\n\nDon\'t use full xpath path and learn to write your own xpath.
