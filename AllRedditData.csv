Help with code to web scrape tripadvisor,https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/10fk2ov/help_with_code_to_web_scrape_tripadvisor/,webscraping,"Hello! I have had help building this chunk of code but from this point on, I have no clue how to add the pagination. My goal is to gather the email data of all the hoteils on this link :  
[https://www.tripadvisor.pt/Hotels-g189100-Portugal-Hotels.html](https://www.tripadvisor.pt/Hotels-g189100-Portugal-Hotels.html)  


So, for example, if I wanted to scrape the info of the 3 first pages, i would print the name of the hotels and their respective email. 

Any piece of advice? I wouldn´t mind paying if I could get some help :)",[]

I have been researching various options such as Heroku and Vercel, but webscraping violates their terms of use.

I would like to know what others have found to be the best platform for hosting web scraping backends and why. Additionally, if you have any experience with a specific platform and its ability to handle web scraping, I would appreciate any insights you could provide.

"Facebook graph API: ""please reduce the amount of data you're asking for error""",https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/10f9tu4/facebook_graph_api_please_reduce_the_amount_of/,webscraping,"I know, if you're asking nicely to an API then it's not *real* scraping -- but official developer channels gave zero shits about this (figures) so mayyyybe it's worth a shot here? 

I'm working on a custom solution that gets *owned* page posts and comments for a client, for analytics reasons. Client manages some 25+ pages, of which all but one are localised versions, and one is a global page in English, which is the default to where FB users not included in all the different locales get redirected to. 

Everything is working OK (it's mostly `<page_id>/feed` and `<post_id>/comments` requests) *except for the global page*. 

When trying to access that via the /feed endpoint all I get is the **""please reduce the amount of data you're asking for""** error, regardless of *limit* set on the request or the number of fields requested. I can set that limit to *one* and still get the error, regardless of the amount of fields I'm requesting.

I googled a bit during the past days and it seems that DOM with javascript are popular. I don't know what the best way is but I like to know more about webscraping. What tutorials, books, etc.. would you recommend a newbie ?","[""I wrote several in-depth introductions in various languages:\n- [Python](https://scrapfly.io/blog/web-scraping-with-python/) (Python is recommended for web scraping as it's a very strong data language)  \n- [Javascript (NodeJS)](https://scrapfly.io/blog/web-scraping-with-nodejs/)  \n- [R](https://scrapfly.io/blog/web-scraping-with-r/)  \n- [PHP](https://scrapfly.io/blog/web-scraping-with-php-101/)  \n- [Ruby](https://scrapfly.io/blog/web-scraping-with-ruby/)\n\nThough here's a quick primer: all you need to scrape the web is a way to retrieve the web content (HTTP client or a web browser) and a way to parse it (HTML or JSON parser). Most programming languages has these two things!\n\nHTML parsing is a bit complicated, but HTML is a machine-readable format that represents a tree of elements:\n\n```html\n<head>\n  <title>hello world</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <h1>Product Name</h1>\n</body>\n```\nJust from indentation you can see the tree structure of this format and imagine how would you navigate to a particular element like `h1` -> `body->h1`.\n\n This is great for parsing as you can rely on strong, predictable structure to find the data instead of using regex where you rely on unpredictable text patterns (easy to break). To parse HTML there are 2 popular standards: \n- [CSS selectors](https://scrapfly.io/blog/parsing-html-with-css/) that's the stuff you use to select elements to apply CSS styles for (e.g. `.product>.title{color:blue}`)\n- [XPath selectors](https://scrapfly.io/blog/parsing-html-with-xpath/) similar to CSS selectors but more powerful. Were invented to parse XML documents when that was the dominant data format (compared to today's JSON)\n\nThe other hard part is blocking. HTTP is a very straight-forward protocol. You ask for something and you get it - a done deal!

Is this a fair price for web scraping?,https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1097o1y/is_this_a_fair_price_for_web_scraping/,webscraping,"Hi all,

After messing around with Github and realizing I know absolutely nothing about Python, I'm thinking about commissioning someone to do a project using Python script to scrape the Jeopardy archive at [J-archive.com](https://J-archive.com) into CVS files using 6 fields (air date, round, category, value, answer and question). I wouldn't be looking to scrape the entire archive, but instead from the year 2020 to the current date. Here's a few examples of parsers that perform(ed) this job featured on Github repositories: [https://github.com/whymarrh/jeopardy-parser](https://github.com/whymarrh/jeopardy-parser)

[https://github.com/jbovee/j-archive-parser](https://github.com/jbovee/j-archive-parser)

Knowing nothing about Python, I have been unable to get those parsers to work for me, so I took to Fiverr in order to get a quote on how much it would cost to have someone do this. After chatting with the guy for a while he said he could do it and asked me what my budget was, which I found a little curious because I was assuming he was going to quote me at least some kind of rough price and then we'd go from there. When I responded that I didn't come in with a set idea for a budget and instead am looking for someone who can perform the project and give me an estimate on a price he came back with $130. When I told him to let me do some more research and think about it he immediately dropped the price to $90, which is the point where I started to get car salesman vibes.

I don't know what a fair price for a project like this is, and I'm certainly not disputing that this price may very well be fair, and obviously I want this deal to be good for both sides, but how we got to that figure made me think I better at least go to Reddit and ask.

What kind of features would you like such a service to have?

Currently I offer 2 main functionalities:

* Scraping API. It returns data from a target URL using proxies either purely as HTML or scraping specific fields and returning them as JSON
* Crawling. In the user panel users can configure scraping profiles to be used for different web pages with an UI that allows you to interactively click on elements of the target page to be selected for scraping. Full website crawling is configurable by creating a crawling agent which consists of list of URL patterns which should either be followed and/or scraped using an extraction profile. All this can be run as a job resulting in a JSON or CSV file with rows populated from all scraped pages.

Hi,

I'm working on a small project for personal use (nothing commercial) and I want to try residential proxies to avoid getting CAPTCHA challenges.  
I want to buy a few GB for a trusted/premium provider cause I need those proxies to work at the money time.  
I've contacted Oxylabs but they won't access my url (although my project is 100% legit).  
I also see that this kind of URLs are also banned in Smartproxy, both of the providers have an extensive list of urls that they won't serve.  
Few questions to the experienced folks here:

  
1. Can any of you recommend a legit/trusted provider which has a pay-as-you-go plan and will sell few GBs at a reasonable price (10-20 $ / GB) and doesn't have that strict compliance   
and won't let me down with low quality addresses ?  
2. What do you think of Packetstream.io ? I see a lot of complains about people that share their bandwidth getting paid for the traffic they share, but what do you think about the IPs they provide to their clients ? I'm sure they aren't on par with Oxylabs but for me as a client, will it be throwing away 50$ ?

What i have done : 

value = soup.find('input', attrs={'name': 'stockId'}).get('value')

print(value)

thread-safe: a simple tool for saving local copies of your favorite Twitter threads,https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/101f7tx/threadsafe_a_simple_tool_for_saving_local_copies/,webscraping,"Hey Everyone,

Happy new year! I wanted to share a CLI tool I built for saving a local copy of any Twitter thread. It's called thread-safe and it's designed to do just that - keep your favorite threads safe on your local machine. This way you never have to worry that they might one day just disappear...

More seriously, I wanted a simple way to save threads of interest \_without\_ having to use a third-party app that needs access to my Twitter account (or vice-versa) and that forces me to reply to the thread to ""unroll"" or otherwise save a copy.

thread-safe generates an HTML file containing all of a thread's contents including each tweet's text, links, and media attachments (images and videos). This file, all attachments, and a JSON data file are saved to the local filesystem and the HTML can be used to display the thread locally in a browser at any time.

By using a dedicated directory for all generated files, thread-safe can be used to maintain a local library of saved threads that can easily be searched using standard commandline tooling like (rip)grep, fzf, fd, and any other awesome tool of your choice.

I built thread-safe because I often find myself saving links to informative threads and am interested in preserving the author's content. This is exactly the use case that thread-safe addresses: generating local copies of these single-authored, consecutive series of tweets. Notably, thread-safe intentionally does not save the comments or discussion from other users that follow.

I hope you might find it useful and I'd love to take any feedback or suggestions that might come to mind!",[]

I would like to extract the sku number from this site  [https://www.nespresso.com/se/se/order/capsules/vertuo](https://www.nespresso.com/se/se/order/capsules/vertuo) but I don´t know how.

The SKU number is not visible on the website but is in the background e.g( Nb-sku-coffee id=""109877"" where id is the product number) The Sku number is the ID of all product.

Could someone help me and explain how to extract this data that is not on the front page.

I’ve made a few searches and found old replies to the same question but there are two differences to what I’ve learned trying to scrape the “My Orders” pages…

First, there’s no built-in report function for my country (Italy).

a. Either I download the whole thing and somehow search locally on my pc, though it'd probably take a lot;  
b. Find a software that crawls the site and then apply a filter to that username to find the posts they've reacted to.

But you can of course bypass that with some proxies.\n\nI never used tumblr before so let say it has the same format as following and followers. If you only wanted to find the posts that you were following then that would be a doable task.\n\nYou can simply use python requests to each username you follow and then copy down each posts link.

I'm currently trying to scrape all data from a website. The site is structured well, so my approach was to start at the home page, and work through scraping all links from each 'level'. so start at the home page, get all it's categories, then go through the categories one-by-one to get their categories, and so on.

So far, it's worked decently well, but the code was becoming a mess, so I decided to do a big refactor. One of the main things that I did, was I created cache CSV files to store each link, as opposed to using in-memory lists that I was using prior. I figured that by caching the links, I could go directly into a deeper web-page without having to scrape over the entire thing every time.

The bug is that whenever I try to navigate to these links from the CSV file, I get a 403 error. But if I run the branch where everything is still using in-memory lists, I get 200's for each response and am able to walk through the website as normal. I have already checked the URLs on both branches and they're consistently a match. If I navigate to the pages manually on both branches, they work.

For context, I'm using Python 3.9 with the BeautifulSoup4 and Requests modules on a Windows 10 machine.","[""If you're getting 403, it might mean that the website blocked your request for scraping.

 I'm trying to make a simple scraper to make a list of apartments on craigslist. But had a hard time so just trying to get it to print the number of search results first for now.

I'm not sure why this code isn't working. 

    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    
    session = requests.Session()
    # Make a GET request to the Craigslist page
    url = ""https://newyork.craigslist.org/search/mnh/apa#search=1~gallery~0~0""
    headers = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/108.0.0.0 Safari/537.36'}
    page = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    
    # Make sure the request was successful
    if page.status_code != 200:
        print(f'Error: request returned status code {page.status_code}')
    else:
        # Parse the HTML of the page
        soup = BeautifulSoup(page.text, 'html.parser')
    
        # Find the element with the class ""result-count""
        result_count_element = soup.find('div', {'class': 'result-count'})
    
        # Check if the element was found
        if result_count_element is None:
            print('Error: element with class ""result-count"" not found')
        else:
            # Extract the text of the element and split it by space
            result_count_text = result_count_element.text.split(' ')
    
            # The first element in the split text should be the number of search results
            result_count = result_count_text[0]
            print(f'Number of search results: {result_count}')
    

It prints: Error: element with class ""result-count"" not found

as far as i can tell it should be finding this result-count and printing 1,773

Advice for scraping massive number of items faster?,https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/znweub/advice_for_scraping_massive_number_of_items_faster/,webscraping,"As the title says, I have a project but wanted your advice in general.
I am currently scraping a website with 220K+ product pages.
I am using requests/beautifulsoup and concurrent futures to get the data as fast as possible.
The script still takes around 6-8 hours to run, and if I get an error at the 100k mark for example, I lose all the data that was scraped.
So I was wondering what your methods are to scrape massive datasets as fast possible? Would love some advice","['Okay, here is some practical advice.\n\n(1) Save the data as you scrape like others have said.\n\n(2) Record requests which returned errors somewhere to retry them. You can automate this part.\n\n(3) Instead of using concurrency, rely upon asynchronous requests. Scraping is not a CPU bound operation.\n\n(4) Asynchronous setup will make 100s of requests per second, so you will likely get blocked. In order to circumvent it, you will need to use a lot of proxies.\n\n(5) If you want more speedup which will be probably overkill at this point, use multiple computers with asynchronous scraping setup. I should add that it might look like a DDOS attack on the target website, so play nicely. \n\n\n\nI think this should be sufficient. You can make the scraping arbitrarily fast (roughly) if you already have or you can generate all links to be scraped in advance and then feeding it to this distributed scraper. Your main bottleneck will be number of proxies with this infrastructure.', ""Save the data as you scrape it so you don't lose it.\n\nStart the script, go to bed, next day you have all days scraped, ready to parse."", 'Crawl it first, parse it later.

It should be faster than GET. \n\n If you’re looking to use a different tool, I recommend Scrapy, but I doubt it’s that much faster.

It should be slightly faster, since you’ll be using less memory.', 'Following as I feel I can learn a lot for my own projects with similar framework.

Initially, each page scrape will take \~ 60 seconds. After the initial data scrape/save, each page scrape should take \~ 15 seconds.

I started researching the Lambda concurrency options, and it still seems like the process/code/config will be long & complicated.

Conversely, I ran a multi-threaded Python script from my local mac, and it successfully made it through the \~ 24K pages in \~ 16 hours (with max 15 seconds a page scrape). I just don't want to have to run locally everyday - I want it to run offsite/cloud automatically.

Thoughts/suggestions?","['Can you provide more details about the code you wrote?

Now I started my Own personal scraping project to test this out and I have used possibly every combination of tools and every thing I could think of to make my scraping project go faster but It will never be as fast or even 50% as fast as those online website.

For example, there was a public post with 8k comments that I wanted to get the people name to test rhe scraper. And I had to wait until all comments are loaded (which I have to trigger the 'load more' button) to get the names.

After good 13 mins, I got the list. But using phantom buster, I got it after 2 mins only!

How do they even get it that fast with JS involved?? 

I remember Instagram had a secret special character that you put at the end of URL to make it load data without Js or something but I don't know about Linkedin.

I am not talking here about bot detection and blocking or bypassing log in or anything. Just the speed of scraping js-rely website.

EDIT 1: 

After karllorey, comment about the mobile version, let me say I did a similar experiment with Facebook. 

So there was a project that we wanted to scrap the posts of a selling group we owned on Facebook that had more than 1500 daily posts in India. The project involved getting data that could reach to a point where the V8 JS engine of Chrome/Firefox couldn't handle it anymore. 

So, I found an older version of the Facebook site targeted at old mobiles that only load 20 or 40 posts at a moment, and when you press load more, it destroys the previous DOM. 

It was overall faster and the memory was doing great. 

Do you think LinkedIn could have a similar platform or something? 

I don't think PhantomBuster save the posts in thread though or something similar because I tried on different post types and they were all similar results average of 2-2:30 mins.

Bonus Content about Benchmarking and testing: 

My experiment involved benchmarking the time from the moment the comments section were loaded, didn't take into consideration the startup time or anything else (because they can be altered by reusing the same browser and different optimizations) 

I also tested different tools all on the same post including selenium, playwright and other libraries that could parse JS. 

I believe as @VestaM mentioned in his comments it is about API exploiting but maybe it takes too much time to research it.","['Tl.dr its all about research and domain specific knowledge of the field, what might or might not work for targets.\n\nWell. As a person who works in a such company (not your mentioned one) that scrapes a lot of data and fast. I can tell you that its not about the tooling, but the research of targets. If you have to wait for page to load comments then it means there is an api (probably with pagination) that can be accessed and scraped/crawled.\n\nNot for your situation particularly, but also caching scraped data for more than one customer, means that if you requested a scrape via someones scraping api, scraped data is cached somewhere rmq or redis or whatever for next client to take.', ""Very interesting thread, interested to hear others. Just my two cents: On my phone (Linkedin app), I can scroll to the bottom of large comment sections rather quickly.

They have a specific endpoint that hits public LinkedIn profiles. Each API request takes ~2s, and you can make hundreds of concurrent requests at the same time for scale.

is there another alternative for ParseHub? some other tool that's better something opensource I can host locally especially with the need to login I don't feel ok with sharing the password with ParseHub the project is public so anyone can get the password from it

- Other ""generic"" web reports -- basic tables

Access url >> adjust date range >> scrape results >> drop results in Excel

Website blocking me from one computer but not another one. I can't figure the difference.,https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/z7d2u1/website_blocking_me_from_one_computer_but_not/,webscraping,"**TL;DR: Why does a site block one machine but not the other? They are both on the same LAN (same IP address) and are sending identical headers.**

I have a Python script that runs once per day to grab price data from a website. The script visits 5 different pages on the website with a 10 second gap between visits. It doesn't do anything crazy like sending it a million requests per second. Example page that triggers a 403 error: [https://www.apmex.com/product/1/1-oz-american-gold-eagle-coin-bu-random-year](https://www.apmex.com/product/1/1-oz-american-gold-eagle-coin-bu-random-year)

In the past couple weeks, I have been getting 403 Connection Refused errors. When I went to troubleshoot it, I found that the script still worked fine when I ran it from a different computer. We are all on the same LAN, so the target website would see the same IP address from both computers.

I went to [this site](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-http-headers-is-my-browser-sending) with a python script to check the get request headers. Here are the headers it reported:

&#x200B;

||Working Computer|Not Working computer|
|:-|:-|:-|
|ACCEPT|`*/*`|same|
|**ACCEPT-ENCODING**|gzip, deflate, br|gzip, deflate (no 'br')|
|**CONNECTION**|keep-alive|same|
|**CONTENT-LENGTH**|||
|**CONTENT-TYPE**|||
|**USER-AGENT**|python-requests/2.28.1|python-requests/2.25.1|

So I updated the python requests module and modified the headers but I am still getting blocked. Any ideas how to fix?

## Here is the code:

    >>> import requests
    >>> from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter, Retry
    >>> url = 'https://www.apmex.com/product/1/1-oz-american-gold-eagle-coin-bu-random-year'
    >>> s = requests.Session()
    >>> s.headers.update({'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate, br'})
    >>> retries = Retry(total=5, backoff_factor=1, status_forcelist=[502, 503, 504, 429])
    >>> s.mount('http://', HTTPAdapter(max_retries=(retries)))
    >>> # Here are the headers that I will send:
    >>> s.headers
    {'User-Agent': 'python-requests/2.28.1', 'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate, br', 'Accept': '*/*', 'Connection': 'keep-alive'}
    >>> res = s.get(url)

What makes this different when many extensions exist?

1. Some websites are really stubborn to scrape from. We know because we tried 10 of the most popular scraping extensions for our own business. We rebuilt selectors from scratch to cover 99% of all use cases, no kidding.
2. Selects the data you really want. We give you variations of selections to choose from so you get exactly the rows you want.
3. Keeps your data on the cloud. Most web scrapers require you to download your data right away or pay to save your data online. Whatever you scrape is automatically saved so you can access it any day, anytime. Download formats in JSON & CSV.
4. Pagination Hell. Paginating simple table structures with next hyperlinks is easy. What is difficult for others is handling javascript buttons, single page apps and tricky actions. Some extensions only allow pagination on the cloud and charge for it.
5. Primary Keys. To prevent duplicate data, you can set a column as a primary key so that you only get fresh and updated data every time
6. Built for your team. You and others can scrape many websites, from different browsers & devices with a single source of truth.
7. Select once, run anytime. After you create a selection once, you or your team will never re-create it. Anytime you visit the same page, Mad Scraper checks for new data and updates.
8. It's SUPER simple to use. We tried 10 popular web scrapers and made this so much easier to use than all of them. A 1 minute tutorial is all you'll ever need. [https://madscraper.com/tutorial](https://madscraper.com/tutorial)
9. Built for developers. Web-hooks for fresh data and a JSON API link for your applications.
10. We'll listen to you. If you have any suggestion and it's a killer one, we'll work on it in a week or less!

That package named Ballyregan, and it's key features are:
• Proxy fetching - get valid proxies fast. You can also filter while fetching by protocol or anonymity.
• Proxy validation - you can use the ProxyValidator by itself to validate proxies.
• Proxy filtering - you can filter your own list of proxies by anonymity and protocol.

Which has been pre-trained on labeled data beforehand. If the model outputs us a success we’ll add the data, else we’ll discard it. 

The reason why I used machine learning to differentiate  between the text that is important and the irrelevant ones, is because the text I need doesn’t follow a uniform structure, ie every website could have it laid out differently. So regex and basic heuristics is out of the question as far as I know.

The result are pretty disappointing, it’s true positive rate is high, but so is the false positive rate. Has anyone does anything similar, or have any guidance?

Legality of webscraping stock sites,https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/yzvuvt/legality_of_webscraping_stock_sites/,webscraping,"Hi, I've been doing on and off scraping of stock analysis websites (such as [Zacks.com](https://Zacks.com)) for a while now.

I was wondering a few questions regarding the rules. I know for many sites, especially bigger sites that grade stocks like CNN, Benzinga, Zacks, ..., it is absolutely against their TOS to scrape data, but I also see some people, even within this subreddit, say it's legal because it's public data or point to a legal decision. I know there probably isn't a clear line, but are there legal issues/rules/improvements to what I'm doing here:

* Scraping a site around every 10s for a ticker's grading (not 24/7 but maybe for 12hrs every 2 weeks)
* EDIT: the data gathered from this scraping isn't republished, just processed through algorithms and shared between a few of my friends

Is there a frequency that is allowed? Is stock analysis technically copyrighted/property of the site? Could I be sued for doing this?

I just want to get an idea of the rules I should follow to stay out of trouble, thank you!","['No lawyer by any means but, as far as I understand the law you can only copy right it if the analysis required some propriatary algorythm for example that is patented bc if you just draw supports and resistances and look at some indicators to make a conclusion you in theory could do that yourself so it should be fine\n\nwhy these sites have it in their TOS is probably (based on my opinion) to prevent a DDoS attack that is caused by a bunch of people trying to scrape them for data, what wouldnt be a problem if they just make an api so you can get the relevant data easily\n\nHope this helps', ""Not a lawyer but if it's accessible on the web as the  public and you don't overtax the system, fair game.""]"
How to webscrape the rates and currencies from each country?,https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/z01hi0/how_to_webscrape_the_rates_and_currencies_from/,webscraping,"Hi everyone,

"New to webscraping, should I better learn code or use code-free tools?",https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/yxlv4y/new_to_webscraping_should_i_better_learn_code_or/,webscraping,"Hi folks!

Total newbie in web scraping. My (extremely small) knowledge in code limits to basic HTML and CSS.

Context: My company asks me to update the data bases that lists our competitors. I need information such as product name, if they have certain labels (that one is tricky as no one writes the norms in the same way), available sizes, product composition, warranty year and other specific terms to my market and so on. These informations need to be classified in an Excel spreadsheet.

I have never done data scraping but I am pretty sure there is something to do out there. Settling probably takes time as every website has a different layout. Also to note that my target websites are not really e-commerce websites. I work in B2B so it not possible to buy from, these are more ""display website"".

So my question today is, do you think it is worth investigating web scraping for this purpose ? 

If so, considering my (inexistant) knowledge in coding, is it better that I learn coding or use pre-made tools? Do you have any recommandations? 

I have been browsing some free tools (like chrome extension Web Scrapper) even tho I'm still extremely lost. For now, I'd like to keep using free stuff if possible. And once I know how to get things work, maybe I can show some early results to my manager and convince him to put some budget for it. 

Thanks in advance for your help! Any answer or piece of advice will be really helpful!","['Besides free no code tools (octoparse maybe?), you can try scraping APIs, like scrapingfish or others (Google ""scraping API""). \nMy experience with no code tools are not the best-usually they look good on presentation, but I have never get all the data I want, it\'s usually incomplete.\n\nScraping apis require some basic coding skills.\n\nBut first of all - investigate your target sites - what do you see in the source core (right click anywhere on the website and choose ""show source"". Do you see your data, van you just copy/paste it? Is data available on one page, or is there any pagination? How many websites you have to scrape? How often you will be getting data from these sites?']"

im getting this error when im trying to get data from an api and appending that data inside a dictionary.

then at the end im turning that dict into a dataframe using pandas to convert it to\_excel()

im getting the above error after 16334 call.

how can i fix that? ive tried the following:

    url = f'https://www.macmap.org/api/results/custom-duties-by-year?reporter=[dest]&partner=[expo]&product=[hs]&year=[yr]'
    # retry connection in case of error. you can also check all codes using re.status_codes._codes
    retries = Retry(total=10, backoff_factor=1200, status_forcelist=[
    				500, 502, 503, 504, 509])
    # mount the requests of our url with retries
    s.mount(url, HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retries))
    # try response from url
    try:
    	response = s.get(url, headers=user_agent, verify=False)
    # if response is ok get the data
    	if response.status_code == 200:
    		all_data = response.json()
    except ConnectionError as e:
    	print('Error : ' + e)
    	print('status code: ' + response.status_code)
    	print('content: ' + str(response.content))
    	time.sleep(800)
    	response = s.get(url, headers=user_agent, verify=False)
    	if response.status_code == 200:
    		all_data = response.json()

my exception is not catching the error and i tried to set backoff\_factor=1200 so to wait 20 mins incase a call fails but im still getting this same error.

what can i do?","['I\'m pretty sure it\'s port exhaustion... You are probably running out of ports to make calls with.

Custom shortcuts to automate access AI on your Mac,https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/10eau6v/custom_shortcuts_to_automate_access_ai_on_your_mac/,Automate," 

Hello folks,

I'm always amazed by the power of GPT-3 and Open AI.

This post is a combination of both information and promotion, so please bear with me.

I've always wanted to use AI directly on my phone and computer, without having to go to OpenAI's playground or ChatGPT in the browser.

For that, I created a tiny Mac app called Elephas. I have shared the app in this group [in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/1027x84/using_gpt3_to_automate_content_repurposing_for/) as well and got some amazing feedback from the members :)

Since then many users have asked for the ability to add custom commands in the app, that they can use to invoke AI on their computer.

So I've just shipped a feature called ""Snippets"".

With this, **now you can assign custom shortcuts to OpenAI prompts and use them in your day-to-day workflow wherever necessary.**

This is how it works -

https://reddit.com/link/10eau6v/video/401eus15ilca1/player

 There are many more such utility features that can help you get the power of AI in your daily work.

You can get the app here - [Elephas](https://elephas.app/?ref=rAutomate-snippets)

You can try it out for FREE for 7 days.

Appreciate your feedback.

Do let me know any new features that you would like to see in the app.

Thanks",[]

New Research From Google Shines Light On The Future Of Language Models ⭕,https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/10bq9gp/new_research_from_google_shines_light_on_the/,Automate,"Last year, large language models (LLM) have broken record after record. ChatGPT got to 1 million users faster than Facebook, Spotify, and Instagram did. They helped create [billion-dollar companies](https://www.marketsgermany.com/translation-tool-deepl-is-now-a-unicorn/#:~:text=Cologne%2Dbased%20artificial%20neural%20network,sources%20close%20to%20the%20company), and most notably they helped us recognize the [divine nature of ducks](https://twitter.com/drnelk/status/1598048054724423681?t=LWzI2RdbSO0CcY9zuJ-4lQ&s=08).

2023 has started and ML progress is likely to continue at a break-neck speed. This is a great time to take a look at one of the most interesting papers from last year.

Emergent Abilities in LLMs

In a recent [paper from Google Brain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07682.pdf), Jason Wei and his colleagues allowed us a peak into the future. This beautiful research showed how scaling LLMs might allow them, among other things, to:

* Become better at math
* Understand even more subtleties of human language
* reduce hallucination and answer truthfully
* ...

(See the plot on break-out performance below for a full list)

**Some Context:**

If you played around with ChatGPT or any of the other LLMs, you will likely have been as impressed as I was. However, you have probably also seen the models go off the rails here and there. The model might hallucinate gibberish, give untrue answers, or fail at performing math.

**Why does this happen?**

LLMs are commonly trained by [maximizing the likelihood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~amuham01/LING530/papers/radford2018improving.pdf) over all tokens in a body of text. Put more simply, they learn to predict the next word in a sequence of words.

Hence, if such a model learns to do any math at all, it learns it by figuring concepts present in human language (and thereby math).

Let's look at the following sentence.

""The sum of two plus two is ...""

The model figures out that the most likely missing word is ""four"".

The fact that LLMs learn this at all is mind-bending to me! However, once the math gets more complicated [LLMs begin to struggle](https://twitter.com/Richvn/status/1598714487711756288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1598714487711756288%7Ctwgr%5E478ce47357ad71a72873d1a482af5e5ff73d228f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fanalyticsindiamag.com%2Ffreaky-chatgpt-fails-that-caught-our-eyes%2F).

There are many other cases where the models fail to capture the elaborate interactions and meanings behind words. One other example is words that change their meaning with context. When the model encounters the word ""bed"", it needs to figure out from the context, if the text is talking about a ""river bed"" or a ""bed"" to sleep in.

**What they discovered:**

For smaller models, the performance on the challenging tasks outline above remains approximately random. However, the performance shoots up once a certain number of training FLOPs (a proxy for model size) is reached.

The figure below visualizes this effect on eight benchmarks. The critical number of training FLOPs is around 10\^23. The big version of GPT-3 already lies to the right of this point, but we seem to be at the beginning stages of performance increases.

&#x200B;

[Break-Out Performance At Critical Scale](https://preview.redd.it/n7svd95hv0ca1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=282b88e4c256236b65b23de9b8ac392abbb4e656)

They observed similar improvements on (few-shot) prompting strategies, such as multi-step reasoning and instruction following. If you are interested, I also encourage you to check out Jason Wei's personal blog. There he [listed a total of 137](https://www.jasonwei.net/blog/emergence) emergent abilities observable in LLMs.

Looking at the results, one could be forgiven for thinking: simply making models bigger will make them more powerful. That would only be half the story.

(Language) models are primarily scaled along three dimensions: number of parameters, amount of training compute, and dataset size. Hence, emergent abilities are likely to also occur with e.g. bigger and/or cleaner datasets.

There is [other research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) suggesting that current models, such as GPT-3, are undertrained. Therefore, scaling datasets promises to boost performance in the near-term, without using more parameters.

**So what does this mean exactly?**

This beautiful paper shines a light on the fact that our understanding of how to train these large models is still very limited. The lack of understanding is largely due to the sheer cost of training LLMs. Running the same number of experiments as people do for smaller models would cost in the hundreds of millions.

However, the results strongly hint that further scaling will continue the exhilarating performance gains of the last years.

Such exciting times to be alive!

Review of ChatGPT/AI for LinkedIn for marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/10bf7sg/review_of_chatgptai_for_linkedin_for_marketing/,Automate,"Recently, I found a Chrome extension called Engage AI. I've been using the tool for the past week or two. I wanted to share my experience with it.

The Chrome extension essentially writes comments for you for LinkedIn posts. All you have to do is copy the link of a post and paste it into the extension. The app scrapes information from the post and comments, then it generates a related comment for you using AI.

The comments generated by the extension are accurate and have perfect spelling and grammar. They sound genuine, human, and high-effort, far better than generic comments such as ""Great post"" or ""Thanks for sharing.""

Unfortunately, the comments aren’t always accurate. Occasionally, the app will generate a comment that doesn’t make much sense with the post and I need to refresh it. It’s also a shame that it’s specific for LinkedIn and no other platforms, so you’re out of luck if you don’t use LI.

It's not for everyone, but for someone like me who uses LinkedIn to build relationships with leads for my employer, it's a great help. I feel like VAs could benefit a lot from this, and anyone else trying to stay in front of your target audience on LinkedIn.

Personally, I comment on prospects' posts on a weekly basis. It can take me hours to come up with, say, twenty insightful and well-thought-out comments. With this extension, those hours are reduced to just a few minutes. I've gotten positive feedback from the comments I've made with it so far.

Overall, the app is a great time-saver and saves me the effort of needing to write a comment that makes sense in a field I’m not always familiar with. I’m already on the paid plan, but there’s a free trial if you want to test it out.

If anyone else has tried it, I would love to hear your thoughts.","[""Yeh I tried using ChatGPT recently for an article, asking it to add some stats and cite publications.

Many of our users had been asking for the ability to repurpose their existing blog and newsletter content into social media posts.

They are mostly busy content writers so this can be really useful to them in their day-to-day work.

So I tried a simple prompt - ""Summarize this for a tweet""

I took the content from an [OpenAI Blog](https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research/) and summarized it into a tweet.

Next, I tried another prompt - ""Summarize this into a LinkedIn post""

And that worked alright as well.

If you haven't tried it, I would highly recommend checking it out.

AI is improving rapidly, and there are very few jobs that I think are safe from being automated in the future. CGP Grey actually has an excellent video on the subject [Humans Need Not Apply](https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU).

I don't think that AI will be ready to replace humans tomorrow, but I firmly believe that it will be possible within my lifetime, if not within the next 10 years.

Having said that, I don't think that our society is ready for millions of people to lose their jobs. We don't have a way to take care of or support these people.

Sadly, I think the ""human"" solution to AI will be to ban it, and guarantee that people will get to keep their jobs.

Personally, I'd like to see us move in the opposite direction. Rather than guaranteeing jobs, I'd rather see us guarantee housing, healthcare, education and maybe a Universal Basic Income?

People would have the freedom to work if they wanted to, but they wouldn't be required to. They could take care of their families, pursue higher education or pursue their passions.

I can't pretend to be an expert or to know what the best way to structure that type of society would be.

But if I can, I want to use my energy to work towards it. What is the best way that I can advocate for this? Are there any groups working on this right now?

I’m looking to improve an internal process which currently consists of internal feedback being sent to someone’s email, who then has to manually enter this data into a spreadsheet. This seems like a pretty wasteful process and I also think the lack of anonymity deters colleagues from giving honest feedback. I want to instead collect this feedback from colleagues, ideally as an anonymous form which is easily pulled into a spreadsheet/database.

In my previous role we would’ve used MS Forms, which was great as it would automatically populate a spreadsheet. However we have really strict information governance rules which bans access to MS Forms due to overseas data storage. I have MS Access installed but have never used it before. Is it possible to collect data using MS access? 

I know that there are a lot of paid tools (e.g. surveymonkey) etc that could easily do this. However, I work in the public sector - budgets are very tight and it’s unlikely they would agree to fund this. Even if they did agree, it would have to go through months of approvals, by which point I will be working on a different project anyway.

Chatbot requirements: technical and non-technical things to consider when everyone talks about ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/zjzcsq/chatbot_requirements_technical_and_nontechnical/,Automate,"Hi there! Just want to share some tips on how to craft the right chatbot when everyone talks about ChatGPT. First of all, a custom chatbot company or any chatbot platform that does custom integration can integrate your chatbot with ChatGPT instead of Dialogflow. So yeah, you can have an outstanding customer service chatbot that can handle other topics. However, the right question is should you? 

If you want a chatbot that does solve issues, not creates more, you must start with **the proper requirements.** Well-structured chatbot requirements lay the right foundation for your future chatbot development.  ChatGPT is just one of the options of how you can use AI and automation and may be not the best depending on your budget and goals. 

**Your chatbot requirements should include these steps:** 

\- defining the main problem you want to solve with the chatbot, 

\- measuring the impact of the problem,

\- determining the main chatbot goal/objective, 

\- understanding the market and target audience 

\- paying attention to the ""internal audience"" of the chatbot (the people or the team in your company who will be working with the chatbot).

Imagine you have found a problem when analyzing customer feedback. Most customers are saying the customer service response time is very long, and that's why they are giving you a low rating.

Your objective for the chatbot could sound like this: *""Decrease waiting time to 1 minute by the end of Q3 2023""* or *""Improve customer service response time from 18 minutes to 1 minute in the next Q""*

Having done this part, you can move to the next step, drafting the technical chatbot requirements. 

When working on the tech requirements, think about the following things:

* **Channels.** Which channels do you want your chatbot to be on? [Website](https://botscrew.com/blog/how-to-build-a-website-bot/), [WhatsApp](https://botscrew.com/blog/a-step-by-step-guide-to-create-chatbot-for-whatsapp-for-business/), Facebook, [SMS](https://botscrew.com/blog/sms-chatbot-a-complete-guide-for-business-use-cases/), [Instagram](https://botscrew.com/blog/instagram-chatbot/), email, etc.
* **Languages.** Which languages do you want your chatbot to “speak”? English, French, German, Arabian, etc? Should it speak one language or multiple?
* **Integrations.** Which tools do you need the chatbot to be integrated with? CRM, payment system, calendars, maps, custom internal tool, etc.
* **Chatbot's look and tone of voice.** If you have a specific vision of the chatbot, be sure to include this in the requirements. Also, if you have a very prominent brand personality and tone of voice, include that in your requirements as well.
* **KPIs and metrics.** Be sure to specify if you have any specific [metrics and KPIs](https://botscrew.com/blog/chatbot-metrics/) you have that you want the chatbot to meet.
* **Analytics and Dashboards.** Do you want the analytics to be in real-time? Are there any specific data you want to have on your dashboard like the number of users, automation rate, etc?
* **Technologies.** Do you have any specific technologies you want the chatbot to be built with? Is ChatGPT the right one for you? What are limitations of ChatGPT? 
* **NLP and AI.** Do you want the chatbot to have decision tree logic, Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), or Artificial intelligence (AI)?
* **Accessibility.** Do you need to meet some specific accessibility requirements like WCAG or ADA?
* **Users.** How many people from your team are going to use the chatbot? How many of your customers or conversations do you expect to use the chatbot?
* **Rich media**. Should the chatbot’s responses include text, hyperlinks, images, gifs, video, and PDF attachments?
* **Security.** Do you have any specific security measures and requirements you want the vendor or the chatbot to meet?
* **Hosting.** Where the chatbot and the user data will be hosted: on your own servers or on the cloud? If on the cloud, what will be the cloud service provider and server's location?

You can consider chatbot development and decide on chatbot vendors when you have a chatbot requirements outline. Here you can find what criteria to have [when deciding between chatbot vendors](https://botscrew.com/blog/essential-chatbot-requirements/?utm_source=RedditDecember&utm_medium=&utm_campaign=&utm_term=&utm_content=).","[""Is DRIFT or any of the equivalent players integrating ChatGPT in to their products yet?

AI + Customized templates to automate writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/zgzdx8/ai_customized_templates_to_automate_writing/,Automate,"Hello folks, 

I'm a big fan of GPT-3 and Open AI.

This post is a combination of information and a bit of promotion, so please bear with me. 

You can use OpenAI to write most types of content like Blog posts, emails, ad copy etc.

But writing the prompts can be tedious, especially if you have to write the same type of content over and ove again.

You can solve this problem by using your own presets (common structure for every type of content)

 For example - there are 2 steps you need to follow to generate blog posts:

1. Step 1 - Define a common structure for all blog posts. A starting point you always use.
2. Step 2 - Pick a topic, and ask AI to generate a blog post on the topic that fits that structure.

You can do this for free in OpenAI's ""Playground""

I also included this feature in my Mac app. Here's what it looks like - 

https://reddit.com/link/zgzdx8/video/gmbhh5nhxv4a1/player

This is a massive time saver for creating any type of content. 

And the part that my users are loving the most is that they can define their own presets and truly make the AI work according to their wishes

Customized to their unique requirements  🤩

If you find this interesting, you might like my app.

There are many such tiny utilities I've built on top of OpenAI. (Including an AI keyboard for the iPhone)

I was thinking if companies would really need their own models or not??

Because big tech companies like OpenAI, Facebook, Microsoft, etc have a large amount of dataset/data with them. And more the data, the more advanced the model is going to be. So mostly they will be dominating the whole machine learning model with AI2B (AI to Business).

Pls, let me know if I'm being incorrect.","['I think some companies will train the large models and most others will retrain those on specialized data sets relevant to an application. This will first be seen in chat models since that is the low hanging fruit and the applications and business case are already understood. My two cents', ""HuggingFace makes importing pretrained models like BERT so easy now, unless you have a niche problem that requires some unique architecture I don't think it makes any sense to built your own model. It's just so much quicker and easier to import and fine tune a pretrained model. Plus you can relatively quickly test out a bunch of different pretrained models and see what works best for your data and hardware constraints. That said you'll still need Scientists and Engineers though to build the pipelines and clean/massage your companies data, as well as fine-tune the model. The vast majority of your time working in AI is spent pipelining, working with data, sitting in meetings, the actual AI part is pretty tiny."", 'If someone makes it FAR, FAR easier, but otherwise most businesses will not.', ""I'd like to see pretrained models being shared and traded.

Best open-source/self-hosted automation tools,https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/z6b5w9/best_opensourceselfhosted_automation_tools/,Automate,"I played a lot with multiple automation tools in the last two weeks. I was focused on finding open-source and free solutions.

I narrowed down my research to these 5 open-source/free automation tools that you can use right away. Two of these are ready-to-use Zapier alternatives.

1- **Huginn** \- Huginn is a system for building agents that perform automated tasks for you. It’s like creating your own personal assistant, but without the need to learn a programming language.

Hosting: Self-hosted.

2- **automatisch** \- It is an automation tool that lets you easily create workflows in your web browser with no coding knowledge required. It's a user-friendly Zapier alternative.

Hosting: Self-hosted (for now).

3- **n8n** \- N8n is an open-source, no-code automation tool that lets you quickly create workflows with its drag-and-drop interface. It is based on nodes so you can connect anything to everything. The best Zapier alternative I've seen.

Hosting: Desktop, hosted, & self-hosted.

4- **Beehive** \- This is similar to how Huginn works. It's an event and agent system. Agents are triggered by events and perform their actions. There are multiple integrations (called Hives).

Hosting: Self-hosted.

5- **Power Automate** \- Microsoft's official no-code automation tool. It allows you to create flows for automating your tasks. It also has a desktop version (included in Windows 11). You can automate almost anything with it.

Hosting: Desktop and hosted (cloud flows - not free).

I have created some flows to automate Google Chrome using Power Automate, which works nicely. I am also using the n8n desktop version to connect multiple services I use.

I have a tedious task that I am hoping that the fine people of Reddit can help me automate or, at the very least, help me implement a more efficient process.

The existing process is as follows:

1. Employees from Company A fill out a PDF form after every client interaction
2. Company A employees save the form in a specific folder for Company A Data Entry Person
3. Company A Data Entry Person prints all forms from folder
4. Company A Data Entry Person enters all fields into an MS Access form controlled by Company B
5. Company A Data Entry Person writes the Unique ID assigned to the MS Access entry in the upper corner of the PDF form paper copy.
6. Company A Data Entry Person files a paper copy of the PDF form in a specific filing cabinet.
7. Company B provides a report to Company A that summarizes Company A's monthly entries into the MS Access DB.
8. Company A Data Entry Person compares Company B report with Company A numbers (gathered by hand counting specific fields on the paper copy of the PDF forms).
9. Company A Data Entry Person corrects or disputes any discrepancies and informs Company B Data Entry Person that they can rerun the number and provide a new report.

Some variables to consider are as follows:

* Company A does not have access to anything in the MS Access DB except the MS Access forms. This is a contracted job that pays based on what is input into MS Access DB.
* PDF forms get assigned a unique ID when submitted into MS Access. The ID gets written on a paper copy of the PDF form to associate what is input in MS Access. It is how Company A disputes discrepancies between Company A's and Company B's data. Ideally, the data matches between the two. However, they never do.

I will add that the PDF form originated as a Word document supplied by Company B. I am open to converting back to the Word version if it helps. I couldn't see that being the appropriate file type for this application.

I believe that is the most relevant information that I can provide but will provide more if needed.

Power Automate vs. Python,https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/ypvyh0/power_automate_vs_python/,Automate,"Hi Everyone!

I'm working on my MS in Data Science and would consider myself proficient in Python. I just started a new job and I'm sitting through some very long training sessions on Power Automate, which I've never used or heard of before. 

From what I've seen thus far, it seems like Power Automate is just a bad way of writing code and automating things. Seems like it would be easier to just write a script and use Task Scheduler to run it to check for triggers. 

Am I missing something here?

Thanks!","['*Note: I\'m operating under the assumption that you\'re talking about Power Automate Desktop (the RPA software), not Power Automate (the cloud service), since you mentioned Task Scheduler. If this assumption is incorrect, please explain why you\'re comparing two very different types of solutions. Otherwise, read on.*\n\nSure, it might be ""easier"" to ""just write a script and use Task Scheduler to run it,"" but take a moment to think about all of the implicit prerequisites in that statement. \n\nFor starters, you\'d have to know at least one scripting language inside and out, forwards and backwards. I\'ve been writing PowerShell, Python, Bash, and even Batch (CMD) scripts for many years, some as far back as the DOS days, and even I\'m not skilled enough in any of those languages to fully replicate all of the features that can be strung together in Power Automate Desktop, which doesn\'t require even a single line of code. Then there\'s the whole process of tinkering with the options in Task Scheduler until you find the right ones that make it work the way you want. And of course you\'d better hope you didn\'t leave any weird bugs in your code that only appear under very specific circumstances, because debugging a script running in the background with the screen locked is not for the faint of heart.\n\nNow, pretend you\'re an average non-technical office worker with a lot of repetitive tasks on your daily to-do list, which really ought to be automated, but you\'ve never written a line of code in your life, and your IT department can\'t/won\'t write the code to automate those tasks for you. What are your options? You could spend the better part of a decade (or more) learning how to code and building a skill set broad enough to cover all of your automation use cases, but where are you going to find the massive amounts of time for all that extracurricular work, especially considering that you already have too much work on your plate as it is? Also, what if you\'re just not very good with technical stuff? Are you just S-O-L?\n\nEnter Power Automate Desktop. If you\'re a god-level scripting wizard, you simply aren\'t part of its target demographic. Sorry to disappoint you. But if you\'re a normie like 95% of the users out there, drowning in repetitive tasks at work, and you\'d really like to automate at least some of your daily processes, but don\'t have the time/energy/resources/etc. to code it yourself, then you are exactly the type of person Power Automate Desktop was designed for.', ""It is a pro/con situation. You can throw together things in the MS universe with power automate in almost no time. It takes care of the authentication and a bunch of tolerances because it is first and foremost meant to be rode hard by business users. You can start to get some advanced features to do things. Generally, if it is in the MS universe or has an API that plays nice with power automate then you can use power automate. \n\nPower automate will run into maintainability issues. I don't think it has any decent version control. The interface will start to get clunky and requires workarounds sometimes. It's fine. \n\nPython is another tool that has a place. Easier? IDK maybe sometimes. Sometimes maybe not.   You might find pulling data from a bunch of MS sources is done in PA and then analyzed in Python. Or you write an API that the PA script works with. \n\nPowerapps itself ends up relying on PA for a bunch of things. I wouldn't be surprised if a bunch of other power platform things work easier on PA than python, but that sounds more like a future-you problem :)"", ""Power automate works great for very simple apps but isn't great at anything complicated. \n\nNo version control, no ability to have multiple people working on it at once, just overall not maintainable. \n\nBusiness leads pushed it because they were told it was easier than normal development and there would be huge cost savings. In reality, it was a huge burden and resulted in workaround after workaround just to get things working the way the business wanted it.\n\nAfter about 6 months we decided to abandon it and go back to regular development. \n\nIn short, it's too simple for regular devs and too complicated for non-devs."", 'My first instinct is that for Unreal Engine, people use a combination of C++ and Blueprints, which is just a way of coding in C++ in unreal engine to speed up processes and visualize your logic, making it easier to see patterns and troubleshoot.\n\nWhat people say is that certain things are suited more for hard coding while others are suited for blueprints.\n\nSo, maybe to help prime your mind for openness on something more visually set up....\n\nDifferent tasks are suited to different tools, and sometimes ones experience with one tool is a major factor on which tool is more ideal to use.', 'I use it mostly for onboarding or off boarding processes where users fill out a form and then it goes through an approval process before continuing the next steps or reaching out to some api to create their user in some system and then sends them an email with instructions. A Microsoft Form can only be accessed within the org if you use office 365.', 'Following', 'Some of the comments definitely touch on some of the benefits like authentication, ease of use for non-devs, etc. \n\nI might say the closer comparison might be it’s sibling Logic Apps. Do I create it using a low-code option or do I write an Azure function with code?\n\nIf you have a lot of integration with different apps, the ease of connecting and having someone not necessarily a developer supporting and maintaining definitely makes Power Automate / Logic Apps enticing, particularly if you aren’t familiar with all of the different SDKs with different apps and having to maintain secure credentials. \n\nOne thing that Python has a leg up is straight up performance. With Power Automate, you sacrifice performance by adding overhead that makes an easier UI and have it take control of auth. and everything. \n\nIf ease of use is your main concern for non-devs or you have a lot of integrations with apps, Power Automate might be user. \n\nIf your main priority is performance and speed of the actual process, Python can be tuned to be much faster. \n\nIf it is something I need to be fast and do a zillion times a day, the ROI of building in code makes sense.', 'Watching']"

(\*\*\* insert you know i'm something of a developer myself joke \*\*\*).   


Anyways I allways enjoyed scripting but at the end of the day those inputs require human interaction to activate.... I know this is not strictly true because you always can use an api to retrieve recent information and activate those macros... but its painful to build an api for every game, chart software or website.  


My question is, its 2022, is there any nice machine learning screen recognition library or framework? do you guys know where should I start looking? Im open for any language  


What I want to build is a software with that library that allows me to:  
\- Input the screen pattern to activate  
\- Set up a script to use when the pattern is detected  
\- Listen to all screen events  
\- input a screen pattern to stop  
\- the program stops and continue listening  


Is that approach valid? Is it too bad for computer performance? is there any better way to automate scripts without reading screen events?  


Thanks all and excuse my english.","['You mean Image recognition not screen recognition, screen readers are accessibility tools designated for blind people to interact with the computer.\n\nFYI Image recognition refers to the task of inputting an image into a neural network and having it output some kind of label for that image. The label that the network outputs will correspond to a pre-defined class. There can be multiple classes that the image can be labeled as, or just one. If there is a single class, the term ""recognition"" is often applied, whereas a multi-class recognition task is often called ""classification"".  \n\n\nYou can use Tensorflow or/with Keras to build your own image clasification software and connect it to a python screen capture software such as Pyautogui to clasificate the images and respond, but i dont know how performatic it will be']"

# Text to Formatted Jpg

I have hundreds of text files that I need to use to make videos overlaid by audio. Essentially what I need to do is take a text file and convert it to an image like a jpg, and then repeat. Between the text file and jpg file, I need some formatting done, so it no longer looks like a text file.

so basically I need to repeat the following process a couple thousand times.

1. Text file
2. Format text file
3. convert to jpg

any help or suggestions much appreciated

Process mining as a non-data scientist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/y8fm48/process_mining_as_a_nondata_scientist/,Automate," Hi all,

For the past years I have been working in finance (and operations) for a mid sized corporation. I was introduced to process mining a while ago (just in presentation form). It also popped up in a recent job I am interviewing for. Both times people referred to Celonis as the software of choice.

I am wondering whether picking up process mining as a non-data scientist (university finance degree and a love for IT) is doable? I mostly worked with excel (not a specialist, but proficient) for finance purposes and do not consider myself to be a data scientist. I have no experience in programming outside of some light VBA work. Would picking up software like Celonis be relatively okay or would this be a huge challenge? Is process mining more aimed towards true data scientists or is this also applicable to more general business analysts?

Thanks in advance for some insight!

Best,

Brandermant","['I am familiar with Celonis and process mining, though I haven’t actually used their software, but I would guess like most analytics software that it will box your analytical range into what the creators of the software intended for you to answer. Therefore, it will only be a helpful skill if you work for a company that uses their software in the future. Data Scientists usually prefer to do analytics using open source programming languages, because it is so much more flexible at gleaning insights out of all kinds of data.', 'What’s the difference between process mining and RPA?', ""I work with celonis. There is rpa, Tableau, data scientists, and celonis team all in different departments.\n\nThe thing that most companies are stuck at is... what's my next action. Even the fanciest award winning dashboard may display the problem but it can't automate the next action. Celonis can or with rpa together do it. Celonis i think is bigger picture with the mapping side. The rpa teams want to use celonis to pave the way for their automations to know what to automate and then to gage if the issue was actually fixed.\n\nSkill wise to administer it you need sql and to do the fancy stuff python or r. If not you'd be browsing the dashboards to find areas of concern and develop use cases on automatation so the dev team can work on it.\n\nTo give an idea of why I think it's important to add this tool to your skillet is that the big 4 consultancies signed on as partners over the last year and some of the largest companies use the software including many of the big tech companies which are early adopters for useful tools.""]"

A different one for each submission. All it takes is plain G-Forms and a small Apps Script.

Here's how (stripped-down example):

1. Create a new form
2. turn on ""Make this a quiz"", set ""Release grades"" to ""Immediately after each submission""
3. can have ""Collect e-mails"" on or off, does not matter
4. Define the question, do *not* give an answer scheme. In my case, I have one called ""Variation"". Details on why the form needs to be a quiz: see below
5. Add yet another Question (non-mandatory!) called ""Feedback""
6. Edit the confirmation message to sth like ""Click 'View Score' to see the result""
7. In the 3-dots menu (upper right), open the script editor
8. Paste a variation of this script (you can determine feedback in the script, call a webhook like I do, look sth up in Sheets, whatever)

&#x200B;

    function myFunction(e) {
      var form = e.source;
      var response = e.response;
      var variationItem = form.getItems().find(item => item.getTitle() === 'Variation');
      var feedbackItem = form.getItems().find(item => item.getTitle() === 'Feedback');
      var variationResponseText = response.getGradableResponseForItem(variationItem).getResponse();
      var feedbackResponse = response.getGradableResponseForItem(feedbackItem);
      var didAddFeedback = false;
      if (!feedbackResponse.getFeedback()) {
        console.log('Adding feedback - chosen option: ' + variationResponseText);
        var webhookUrl = 'https://<whateveryourapi>?variation=' + encodeURIComponent(variationResponseText);
        var webhookResponse = UrlFetchApp.fetch(webhookUrl, {headers: {'X-Test': 'whatever'}}); // can also have API key headers, etc.
        var webhookBody = JSON.parse(webhookResponse.getContentText());
        feedbackResponse.setFeedback(FormApp.createFeedback().setText((webhookBody[variationResponseText].ordered ? ('We ordered ' + variationResponseText) : ('Sorry, could not order ' + variationResponseText + ': ' + webhookBody[variationResponseText].reason)) + '\nalso check out https://<yourwebsite>/<path>/' + encodeURIComponent(variationResponseText)).build());
        response.withItemGrade(feedbackResponse);
        didAddFeedback = true;
        console.log('Added feedback');
      } else {
        console.log('Feedback already there');
      }
      if (didAddFeedback) {
        console.log('New feedback - submitting');
        form.submitGrades([response]);
        console.log('New feedback - submitted');
      }
    }
    
    function installMe() { // (call manually so far; for addon: onInstall)
      var form = FormApp.openById('<your form ID>');
      ScriptApp.newTrigger('myFunction')
          .forForm(form)
          .onFormSubmit()
          .create();
    }

of course, you can customize / change this - it's just a (working) example to give you an idea

what it does:

* react on form submissions
* add a ""Quiz feedback"" to the one submission (*that* is why we needed it to be a quiz)
* make sure we only add feedback once (you'd have an endless loop otherwise)
* the feedback can contain links that are also rendered as links (can also contain pre-filled links to other G-Forms, even; same goes the confirm message, btw - just that the confirmation message is always the same for all users)

then,

1. run installMe() from the script console. This adds the trigger - it's also visible in the script console then. You'll be asked to authorize an insecure app. As the app is your own: do that
2. Try the form

Hope you find this useful - sure let me know what you think!

Introducing the Basic Post-scarcity Map,https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/xywvt4/introducing_the_basic_postscarcity_map/,Automate,"A society in which all basic human needs are provided at zero or very low cost without significant human work can be defined as basic post-scarcity.

Our civilization is getting close to the point where this is technically feasible.

To reach this milestone as soon as possible, we introduce here the Basic Post-scarcity Map project, an effort to map the current technological state of the art and to understand how far we are from a basic post-scarcity society. We are currently in alpha stage, and we are releasing early to gather feedback and collaborators.

This project is an attempt to provide unbiased answers to the following questions:

* What technological advancements are needed to reach basic post-scarcity?
* What is the state of the art, what resources are available to learn about it and who is currently working on improving it?
* How far are we from achieving basic post-scarcity and what are the bottlenecks?

To accomplish this, the basic idea is to build two maps: the first where we will deconstruct the basic needs needed to reach basic post-scarcity and the technical milestones needed to satisfy them with minimal human work at the minimum cost. The second in which we input and update the state of the art for each of the technical milestones.

References to the current state of the art and the resources needed to learn more about it are collected in separate pages forming a shared library.

This is an open source and collaborative project. All contributions are fact-based, with no projections, opinions, marketing or propaganda.

We believe that having a searchable and living assessment of the state of the art will enable people who want to work towards this goal to know what is needed, what is currently feasible and who is currently working on what.

We are aware of the many limitations of this approach and in particular we know that technical bottlenecks are not the only roadblocks to a basic post-scarcity civilization. However, we also think that it is not unreasonable to assume that reducing the cost and the manpower associated with fulfilling basic needs will make it easier for public and / or private actors to provide them as widely as possible.

Our goal is to make this project simple to contribute and update. At this stage we need help creating technical milestones. Domain experts are particularly welcome to shine light on the state of the art for the relevant milestones in their respective fields.Additionally, anyone with reference materials and / or knowledge of people currently involved in solving these problems can contribute by sharing their resources in the library.

The project is currently live at: [https://postscarcitymap.org/](https://postscarcitymap.org/)

You can make contributions directly to the library by editing the pages on our Gitlab repo: [https://gitlab.com/postscarcity/library/](https://gitlab.com/postscarcity/library/). At the moment the process of updating the tree is still pretty manual, but we plan to automate it more.

If you want to join us as part of the team and contribute regularly, we also have a Discord server: [https://discord.com/invite/vhc8EZkmEv](https://discord.com/invite/vhc8EZkmEv)

We welcome feedback and contributions of any size.","[""For how long have you been developing this? Taking a look now.

&#x200B;

I am working on a research experiment where we teach bumblebees to pass trough a sensor to activate a sugar-water f feeder. The first prototype (picture attached) uses a sensor (left) that activates the feeder. The other sensor (right) records time feeding. We are using MOC70T4 sensors to detect the bumblebees movement responses, however, the first pilot shows that its not working as well we hoped. The bumblebees have to emit a very stereotyped response to activate the sensor, which often leads to repeated and not recorded responses.

Let me give you a example.  Say you have a farming drone which plants seeds then picks them, then you have a Automated truck which drives them to the desired location, then you have a automated chef which cooks it into a pizza. If we can get it to economically scale right it should go like this. Cheaper materials prices because it is farmed in much more abundance and lower cost due to not needing to pay for higher labour -> cheaper transportation due to not paying for a driver -> cheaper pizza due to not needing to pay for a chef. All these benifits should be passed down to the consumer. So instead of charging 10$ for a pizza you can charge 1.50 because of the abundance of productivity. That is how it should go but companys might get greedy.  Although I would say pricing things cheaper would encourage more sales.  Anyways at this point it would make sense to Implement a UBI (universal basic income) and it does not have to be a lot because goods will be much cheaper. A UBI is beneficial because it will keep the money circulating instead of hoarded like big companies do In tax havens.  Also necessary because once you automate a lot of those tasks  a lot of jobs will be lost but that does not have to be a bad thing if it increases productivity and the scenario I laid out can come into fruition. Cheaper goods for everyone long term hopefully and less meaningless 1 dimensional jobs.', 'This is an important question!\n\nAutomation poses two primary dangers, displacement of laborers and future shock. Danger here being negatively affected quality of life, or loss of a way of living. \n\nThe first danger exists mostly as a result of capitalist society equating value to labor productivity (and many issues exist today because wages and productivity fell out of lockstep in the 70s). There are some who would love their job regardless and not want to lose it, and they might not have to. The jobs to be automated first are repetitive simple labor, jobs requiring problem solving or unique solutions are at less risk, as are jobs requiring delicate or abstract techniques (though tech is getting there).\n\nThe second danger is a term from the book of the same name, by Alvin Toffler and his spouse Adelaide Farrell, which is a phenomenon inherent to any disruptive/intrusive technological advancement. Essentially it\'s the psychological stress you feel when ""out of your depth"" with technology or a way of things, as you might see with parents or grandparents unable to manage computers or smartphones.\n\nBoth of these dangers can be accounted for.\n\nMass automation historically is tied to cultural renaissance. Agriculture and the domestication of animals removed the need to scour the land for weeks at a time, the wheel enabled mills to grind grain and much more, writing allows communication regardless of distance and presence (providing much faster dissemination of ideas), the Renaissance proper boosted that further with the printing press - the industrial revolution brought machinery and explosive productivity, steam powered trains brought mass infrastructure, steel and electricity became basic building blocks of our world, oil and mass production with automobiles and the freedom of movement that entails - and now the internet with near instant communication from anywhere to anywhere.\n\n**Short term** benefits we can expect include new business endeavors and ambitions in general from the population, as the necessities are handled by automation more and more time becomes available to pursue aspirations and curiosities. New areas of art and forms of expression. People probably will be less rooted to one place, as they aren\'t being relied on to produce surplus at a daily location anymore. There may be more aimless gatherings of people for the sake of community. Development of language and cultural identity too as interpersonal interactions are less rigidly structured. Decreasing cost of living, more investments, more (good) risk taking behavior.\n\n**Long term** would bring more of the above as well as more advancements in technology and the sciences from resources not having to go towards needs - the chance that an Einstein or Hawking goes unnoticed because they scraped by working at McDonald\'s their whole life or went untreated goes WAY down. In general we could see less conflict over resources, less negative competition and more sportsmanlike competition.\n\nOf course, there are dangers I didn\'t mention at the beginning because they\'re not dangers of automation, they\'re dangers *using* automation. Things like automated guns on drones, soulless interactions with machines when seeking help (think automated 911), or the big bad AI singularity and self replication. I also don\'t consider failures of human morality or judgement to be dangers of automation.\n\nMy biggest concern with automation beyond the transitory period has to do with global resource supply. Automating everything at once will result in limited rare earth elements and an overinvested tech-generation (pushing a technological frontier too hard leads to burnout, a disinterest in further advancements, and the ""needle in a haystack"" problem).\n\nThanks for asking!']"

Help: Automate count of items listed on a website.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/xjw1ba/help_automate_count_of_items_listed_on_a_website/,Automate,"I was trying to figure out if there is a way to automate the count of a particular item listed on a website.

Currently, I am manually going through each location and counting the number of doctors provided. Is there an easier to way to automate this task?

I can cut down on some time using a count on inspect elements but that still requires me to load the entire list and doesn't work when the site redirects to another page.

Industrial SW engineering UX stone age?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/xj14f7/industrial_sw_engineering_ux_stone_age/,Automate,"At my workplace there are lots of different PLCs and other automation equipment which have one thing in common. Catastrophical user experience for engineers who develop and maintain the software (programming PLCs and robots etc.).

Yaskawa MPE720 came out of the stone age, it can not even assign the memory to the variables.  It has to be done manually. Epson RC+ looks like it has been made around '95. Staübli SRS is somehow OK. The best so far I have used is Beckhoff PC PLC - programming environment is MS Visual Studio XAE with all of it's bells and whistles. 

So, which PLC system would be the most contemporary considering SW engineer's user experience? I dream of something that could be programmed in VS Code, with GIT version control and with worker user interfaces built in HTML5 or with some other standard framework?","['Beckhoff will be the closest to what you are describing. However, all PLC/Industrial Control Systems will be fundamentally different than traditional computer software. PLCs run a RTOS and most vary between vendors making standard tools rare. The fact that many systems control equipment where human life is at stake means that changes have to be vetted and are generally slow to market. The major suppliers (Rockwell, Siemens, etc.) are building tools to cater more to the software minded folks. Rockwell’s newest offerings are getting closer. Also, ignition for HMI/Scada is fantastic.

Greenhouse automation project,https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/xhmen3/greenhouse_automation_project/,Automate,"I have Automated greenhouse as my uni project and need help with heating/cooling mode transition. I know that program can't just go from heating to cooling and backwards, as it could result in great energy losses, but there is a great chance that on a sunny winter day you would need cooling mode during the midday and heating when sun goes down. 

So my question is: What conditions should I set for heating and cooling mode, so I can get smooth transitions during the day, and should I add something like standby mode when temperature is in it's setpoint?","[""One easy solution is to have a deadband around the desired temperature. So if the temperature is 80 and the dead band is plus or minus 3 degrees you'd turn on the heater for anything below 77 and turn on the cooling for anything above 83. You do nothing in the deadband (77-83).\n\nThis is fairly common for residential temperature control, but I have no idea what setpoints (or other variables, like humidity) are appropriate for a greenhouse. That sounds like a good candidate for the engineering design process ;)"", ""It could be overly complicated and well beyond the scope of your project, but if you have access to weather forecast data, you can use that as a feedforward variable in your control loop.\n\nEven if you don't end up using it, it's a fun concept that could be worth talking about in your report as something you considered using."", 'Just buy a fan temp monitor it will turn the cooler on when needed and there’s the same device for heating', 'Use CUSUM.

So if it needs cooling on a sunny winter day you'd just open a vent and turn on a fan. So what I am really saying is you need an exterior temperature sensor. \n\nAlso, humidity is very important if it's a real greenhouse. So you will need a dew point sensor as well, assuming you have the ability to control humidity.""]"

I already use the former for another project which monitors entries in a Google Sheets document, populated by Google Forms.

In this new case, I want to monitor output from an outside managed data source. 

##More specifically, my desired workflow is:
1. Retrieve recent EV Charging Stations added to AFDC Database
2. Parse data and filter by a single state, or a selection of ZIP Codes.
3. Post selected column fields to Social Media.

https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze

The data stored here can be retrieved via: CSV Download, HTML Embed, and Developer APIs.

The trick is, I don't know how to pull that data into a Zapier automation. 

Zapier does have a Webhook option, but it is a paid feature.

Is there a way of getting around this? My only other idea was to download the CSV on a schedule, and copypaste into a sheet on a regular basis. But that will require significantly more work on my end.

Any suggestions for how to accomplish this?","[""If you want more bang for your buck, I'd recommend you check out Make.""]"

"Would anyone be willing to share details on how the UIPath pricing works? We are currently on Kofax RPA, I'd love to switch but I fear it will be much more expensive",https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/10dd3sy/would_anyone_be_willing_to_share_details_on_how/,automation,"Hey guys!

I'm the head of our department for Process Automation and one of the tools at our disposal is Kofax RPA. The business bought this in themselves (without telling IT) because a salesman sold it as fine for end users. Out of the 20 that trained, only 1 kept going and managed to DDOS the main system and so it got brought to IT's attention and came under their wing. I was then hired to work with it. I now work with this and several other systems to automate processes.

I love the ease of the software and you can spin up robots so easily. It's not cloud based, but we don't need to have any VMs because Kofax has a sort of emulated desktop where I can run excel, websites etc so we have 2 servers to run the bots as services and nothing else required. It's quick, it's easy.... but I HATE Kofax. 

There is no community, we've been asking for changes for 5 years and nothing happens. They don't offer cloud and our infrastructure if off-shored to TCS and it is always breaking down. The support is non existent. There is no training we had to learn by doing. When you ask their support or training teams, they come back going ""I don't know, we were not trained on this"". Upgrading the on prem software is week's of hard work and planning. The thing is great when it works but so flaky and not getting much investment.

I love the look of UI path but I fear it may end up waaaay more expensive. From what I've seen, you pay per month for the software but you also have to pay per month for each robot? We have 100+ processes running under Kofax and we are on their old licence - so we pay for the amoutn of ""resources"" we use at any given time. So we can run 100 robots just staggered across time so they're not all running at once. And some of the robots are big processes that can take up to a day but only go once a month, and other processes that take days but runs a couple of times a year. I can't pay per robot for a thing that rarely runs (but when it does, it enters 100s of thousands of rates into our system).

I'd love to hear from anybody willing to share a ballpark figure or even just confirm how it works for paying for robots and if I would be shelling out 1000s of dollars a year per process I automate. I will never get that past a business case!

Is ChatGPT a trap for businesses?,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/109c368/is_chatgpt_a_trap_for_businesses/,automation,"I've seen a lot of excitement from various businesses about using ChatGPT to let them reduce their staffing costs in fields like customer service. If you look at the numbers right now, it makes a lot of sense because the costs of ChatGPT are current really, really low. But the terms and conditions of ChatGPT make it very clear that those costs can change, and I wonder if businesses might be walking into something of a trap.   


There's a lot of money to be made in automation, I know, I am an industrial automation engineer. But I expect that OpenAI (the developers of ChatGPT) knew exactly how much money their software could save companies when they developed that software, which is why they did it, and they don't intend to let the companies pocket the lion's share of those savings that they did they work to realize.   


So right now, companies can be early adopters and help ChatGPT build market share, train their AI, integrate it with other software packages and demonstrate it's ability to displace workers in the real world. But companies that go down this route and going to make ChatGPT essential to their business operation. So when ChatGPT decides to 10x, 100x, 1000x their costs, those companies are going to have to pay it, and at that point they may have done a lot of work to make ChatGPT a viable alternative to a human employee only to pay OpenAI some non-trivial percentage of the pay of the human worker their displaced.","[""Not necessarily. It could be that they leave ChatGPT at low cost for small commercial consumers, and make it expensive for larger projects such as government and military contracts. AI will always need to consume a lot of new data, because the world and vocabulary changes constantly. Making it cheap ensures a constant stream of data from small companies, which they can use for their big business contracts.\n\nThat's my two cents, maybe I'm wrong though."", 'Thank you for your post to /r/automation!\n     \nNew here?

Looking for feedback - Users subscribing but not understanding capabilities of product,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/zzfs0a/looking_for_feedback_users_subscribing_but_not/,automation,"I built an application where users can click “record” then perform whatever actions in a browser like add data to CRM, send email, send message etc and then replace whatever value they typed in the recording with a dynamic value from google sheets. For example let’s say you want to send a bunch of users a message on Instagram and you have a list of usernames in a google sheet. You click record, go to Instagram, type in the username, type the message then click send. Then you edit this to use the value from google sheets instead of what you had actually typed.

Most of our users signed up to send automated instagram messages and have understood how that works pretty well but when wanting to automate actions on another site / in a different way it doesn't go too well.

Whatever you record can then be triggered by webhook, new row in google sheet, scheduled etc.

This is working great and we have a number of customers using it to send Instagram messages but they’re not seeing that the same idea can apply to LinkedIn, Facebook, openphone etc. without spending 10-30 minutes on a call they’re not understanding whatever action they record can be performed from a cloud service later with dynamic data so they don’t have to.

I’m a bit overly technical with explanations which is the fault for the majority of this but how would you better train users on the product without getting on 30 minute calls or building resource pages with videos that are just going unwatched

I understand a lot of these things can be done via api, with zapier etc but most users we have cannot do that and for some sites there is no api so there is no real alternative besides hiring a VA/being a developer to write a custom script/giving up your time

When the lathe isn't running, the contactor will pass power as normal and the compressor can run whenever. When the lathe is running, the contactor will close which will open the power circuit for the compressor thus preventing it running. When you stop the lathe, the contactor will open again closing the compressor power.\n\nWithout modifying your lathe: I would simply build a small enclosure with a switch for lathe power.

Previously I was an electrician before pursuing my degrees to become an engineer. Based in Ireland. 

I've always loved automation, I excelled at it in college, plc programming, logic, robotics, but I ended up going down the path of an electrical design engineer mostly since leaving college in 2018, most recently I'm also a control & Instrumentation Engineer. I've been working in proximity to automation engineers throughout some projects and really like the idea of doing the role everyday.

What I'm struggling with is how or can I break into an automation engineer role? I've looked at 100s of roles for automation and I don't see any point in applying as I don't meet the criteria but I know I'd love doing all of the responsibilities! What can I do? I can't think of anything other than completing some PLC dojo courses etc but that still doesn't give me the experience required.

Edit: going back to college full time is out of the question, I've already done this to acquire two degrees.

It all depends on if you really want to learn it. We would train PLC programming and HMI development. That's not something that people can typically get training for in school themselves in most cases. Our engineers, however, might work well beyond just basic programming and HMI development, and more into complete systems integration, including with network and IT systems.

Automating Weq4u.. via Zapier or scripts or something similar?,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/ywvzbc/automating_weq4u_via_zapier_or_scripts_or/,automation," 

We are based in the UK and use a horizon phone system.

One of our departments have to often queue for hours to talk to someone in another call centre they need, it wastes a lot of time, and they are tied up when clients need them, they dont want to put the queued call on hold to talk o a client in fear of missing when its answered.

Weq4u is an excellent free service which takes the sting out of this but with a couple of caveats.

It routes your call queue request based on caller Id so you can't have more than 1. Plus all of our agents have the outbound CID set to our main office number, so that's 1 for the whole company and the return path for that number is our reception. So it can't work from this CID

When you are at the front of the queue it gives you a quick missed call for you to redial from the relevant CID to connect, it doesn't just join in you when you answer the call.

My thoughts were that we could have separate VoIP lines (with any UK provider) for the agents just for managing weq4u, so our agent makes the call out with their unique CID, they join the outbound queue and presses 9\* to end the call, so weq4u does its magic and waits for an agent.  
Then weq4u rings back to that VoIP line (2 rings missed call) to tell it that the agent is ready on the outbound call. We have an automation somehow which immediately rejects the weq4u call based on its CID, then redials it (which you have to do), dials a hunt group (external inbound) number on our horizon system and transfers the call onto that hunt group (or conferences it if that's easier).

I could name the horizon hunt groups based on which agents queue will be calling so that everyone in that department can see that Agent X's outbound call queue is ready to talk, if they are available they will grab it, if they are away or on the phone someone else will grab it and do what's needed so it's not missed.

It's only a small department, currently only 4 but looking to expand to 8 agents, they all sit together and can easily see whos busy and whos not.

It should work in theory, but I've been trawling VoIP systems and automation systems and I can't find an obvious way to make this happen.

The system would need to have unlimited minutes, include the 0333 number in the minutes, and be able to present UK CID's

I would appreciate any pointers or ideas I'm a sys admin (and I do a bit of easy dev), I'm not up on all the VoIP solutions out there.","['Thank you for your post to /r/automation!\n     \nNew here?

Automated testing basics,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/yqjg89/automated_testing_basics/,automation,"Running a large number of tests automatically on the developer's computer, server, or in the cloud to make sure everything functions as intended.

The testing phase of the software development lifecycle is crucial. By handling tedious and repetitive duties like regression tests, automation testing frees up testers to focus on other high-quality activities like conducting exploratory tests and analyzing test findings, among other things. As a result, automation testing makes it possible for you to complete more tests faster.

Manual testing may become challenging as there are more features to test or more software faults to find. Automated testing can help with this.

To keep the software development process productive and effective, automation testing investment is crucial. You may run tests in any environment you require, as frequently as you like, and with automation. As a result, security and stability are improved, time and effort are saved, and maintenance costs are decreased.","['Thank you for your post to /r/automation!\n     \nNew here?

#### Must have

* Copy content from Drive to Confluence Server.
* Retain all content for each file.
* Retain most (if not all) formatting for Google Docs.
* Output a list/inventory to Google Sheets with specific details of what occurred.
* Meet corporate security requirements, including access limitations and data retention.
* Can be tested thoroughly before implementation.

#### Nice to have

* Can determine source file location on Drive side.
* Can recreate source file folder location on the Confluence side. e.g., If the source file was in /documents/taxes/ then it will create a documents page in confluence, a taxes page inside that, and put the file into that target.
* Can read Confluence labels.
* Content reformat or cleanup option. e.g., strip tags, remove markup, things like that.
* Integration with existing Confluence macros.","['Thank you for your post to /r/automation!\n     \nNew here?

Benefits Of Automation Testing,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/yid2dc/benefits_of_automation_testing/,automation,"Automation testing is one of the most popular methods for software testing. It’s an extremely efficient, cost-effective solution that can be adopted at any stage of your software development lifecycle – and it eradicates ambiguity on whether to use automation testing or stick to manual testing.

Automated testing has many benefits, such as: 

**Shift-left testing**\- It is a part of continuous testing that conveys that the testing phase should be incorporated into the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle), right from the requirement gathering phase to find bugs at an early stage. This can save money and time, by ensuring that bugs are found early by a tester.

**Easy regression testing-** Developers may need to perform a set of similar test cases over and over again, just to ensure that the bug has been removed. To make sure all testers have access to the latest changes, they have to spend time setting up the environment on their local machines and then run tests in parallel by creating new test plans and test cases every time. This leads to unnecessary wastage of time, money and efforts.

**Reduced business costs-** Automation testing offers significant benefits. It is advantageous for organizations because it reduces business expenses and enhances the quality of work. With automation testing, organizations are able to reduce additional expenses and maximize resource utilization.

**Improve the quality of manual tests-** With the help of test automation tools, you can perform manual testing very effectively. Test automation helps testers validate testing coverage in different environments and produces the required results at a much faster pace. These benefits of test automation have won customer favors in recent years.

**Better smoke testing-** Smoke tests are considered to be a best practice as they help avoid outages. These tests are used in the early phases of a project, and can catch major issues before tests begin running regularly. Automated smoke tests are an efficient way for teams to do this.","['Thank you for your post to /r/automation!\n     \nNew here?

Importing Youtube History via Clicknium and Python,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/ydzgzn/importing_youtube_history_via_clicknium_and_python/,automation,"Hello Everyone, I created a script to import history from one YouTube account to another. There is likely a better way than this, but since nothing existed I just wrote something quick and thought I'd share.

# The Method and Why

This will automatically iterate over your google takeout export and load each video in your previous watch history so that it can be registered in a new account. I use a 10 second wait between each load to ensure the browser has fully loaded the page and YouTube puts it into your watch history.

I created this because I was trying to move my YouTube history from one account to another, and could not find an option. If you want to fully transfer an account, there is a method for this, but I could not find anything for ONLY transferring watch history.

# Prerequisites

Visual Studio Code (you can use any tool to run the python script, this was my go to)

Vivaldi browser (you can probably modify the code below easy enough to work with others, but this is what I used)

Your watch history exported from google takeout

# Exporting History in Google Takeout

Go to [https://takeout.google.com](https://takeout.google.com) on the account you want to transfer history from

Click ""deselect all""

Scroll down to YouTube and YouTube Music section and check it

Click multiple formats and swap watch history from HTML to JSON then click ok

Click ""All YouTube data included""

Click deselect all

Check the history checkbox then hit ok

Click next step

Send via email to yourself. Depending on your length of watch history this will take a varying amount of time.

# Next Steps

If you do not have visual studio code, install it. Load a folder in it and create a python script (I called it [ImportHistory.py](https://ImportHistory.py))

Login to YouTube in the browser you use with the script below (currently written for vivaldi) with the account you want to import to.

Copy and paste the following into your created script

    from clicknium import clicknium as cc
    import json
    import time
    
    # install chrome extension and open a tab to automate
    cc.chromium('vivaldi').extension.install_or_update() 
    tab = cc.chromium('vivaldi').open(""www.google.com"") #Can be any url, just need to open a tab
    
    # Open the google takeout json for watch history
    with open('watch-history.json', encoding=""utf8"") as f:
        data = json.load(f)
      
      
        #Loop through each item in our history.
        for i in data['history']:
            #If there is a title url we can load it
            if 'titleUrl' in i:
                #Strip the https:// from the url in order to make goto work properly.
                url = str(i['titleUrl']).replace(""https://"", """")
    
                #Open the url and then wait for it to fully register youtube history
                tab.goto(url)
                time.sleep(10) #Arbitrary number, feel free to make shorter if it works
                                
      
    # Closing file and tab
        tab.close()
        f.close()

# After your Takeout is downloaded

Extract the zip and navigate to \\Takeout\\YouTube and YouTube Music\\history\\ where a watch-history.json file should live.

Copy the json file to the same folder as your python script you made.

Run the python file which will open a new browser window and tab. This tab will load all videos in sequential order. It is useful to do this in a single tab as you can right click the tab and mute to let this run in the background while you continue doing whatever else.

# How Long Will it Take?

This depends on how long your watch history is, but roughly 10 seconds per video in your history. This might take a really long time. You may try shortening the time.sleep(10) to a smaller value. I was able to successfully run as low as 5 seconds, but this started to cause some issues with not all results being put in my youtube history (likely due to load times).

# Modifying To Use Another Browser

The only lines you should need to change to make this work with another browser is the first two that install the chrome extension and open a tab, specifically

    cc.chromium('vivaldi').extension.install_or_update() 
    tab = cc.chromium('vivaldi').open(""www.google.com"") #Can be any url, just need to open a tab

Clicknium supports other browsers, and if you change this to open a tab on a different browser it should work fine, but you may need to modify it slightly as I have not tested in any other browser.

&#x200B;

Hopefully this helps someone, but if you have the ability to just transfer an account I would recommend that as it is faster.","['Thank you for your post to /r/automation!\n     \nNew here?

I recently posted in r/processmining but I'd like to repost in this channel since there is a wider audience that might have been involved with business process consulting. 

I am an industrial PhD candidate and my research is centered on Explainable AI in Process Mining.

If anyone here had previous experience with explainability strategies in PM consultancy - both as an expert or client - I would value your input for an online research questionnaire on the subject.

It should take no more than 10-15 min and you will be granted access to further insights on explicability strategies through the forthcoming scientific research article, plus the chance to participate in online focus groups.

Anyway to automate or macro this game modding process?,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/xsoo9l/anyway_to_automate_or_macro_this_game_modding/,automation,"So I'm part of a modding community for older NHL  games. One of the things we do is remove retired or young player portraits from the game and update with new images.  This is a time consuming process that takes 5-10 minutes per player. I appreciate we could probably get an app build but wanted some ideas about how we could automate speed up the process.  Its time consuming because we need to decrypted extract files make changes in Photoshop then rebuild. I have copied the instructions below but note its missing images as its a PDF. 

&#x200B;

Step 1: Find portrait ID  
Ex: McDavid, Portrait ID 9857  
Step 2: BIG File Extractor  
Open BigF  
Step 3: Find portrait  
Note, there are two locations. USRDIR\\fe\\ion\\artassets\\playerheads and  
USRDIR\\fe\\ion\\artassets\\playerheadssmall  
Both of these will need to be updated. One is for menu, one is for in-game.  
There are 3 folders within to split up the portraits, and one for blank silhouettes  
In this case, McDavid is in p8001\_12000, as we are looking for p9857.  
After selecting it, this should be your screen:  
These files all have their own use, and the names are all different depending on the portrait.  
Extract all to a new folder, I name it the portrait ID.  
We are looking for the Refpack compression that is not file 0. It is always the file with the biggest file  
size. In this case, it is file 3512.  
Step 4: QuickBMS decompression  
Open up QuickBMS and use the script refpack.bms  
Select the file name we found  
Save it in the same folder.  
Step 5: Photoshop  
Now there is a .dds file to edit. Open it up in photoshop.  
This is what we get  
Looks just like what is in the game with one difference – the black background. This is solved by  
using an alpha layer so we get what appears in the game:  
We’ll keep this in mind for later. For now, lets replace it with an updated portrait. Make sure the  
bottom of the picture cuts off where it did in the original.  
Now, lets get back to the alpha layer.  
In the bottom right corner in Photoshop, where you can add/change layers, there is a “channels”  
menu. Select it  
There are 5 layers. RGB, Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. Select the alpha layer.  
Lets make it completley black. I use Alt+Backspace as a shortcut to fill the image black.  
Now, go back to layers, then hold Ctrl+Left click on the thumbnail for the portrait to select it  
Go back to Channels and fill that selected part in with white. I use Ctrl+Backspace to fill it in.  
Notice now if you turn on the visibility for RGB (and keep Alpha visible) there is a red tint. This will  
not show up in the game, but the rest of the image will.  
Save the .dds, you can overwrite the old one if you want, or save it as a new file. But make sure you  
use these settings:  
Step 6: QuickBMS Compression  
Open QuickBMS with the refpack\_compress.bms script. Select the .dds file you just saved  
Save that in the same folder.  
Now, you notice the folder contains a new file.  
Delete the original file, in this case 3512. Then, rename the compressed dds file to be that name,  
with no extension. You can also delete the unpacked dds file. Your folder should look like this:  
Step 7: Rebuild .big  
Back in the BIG File Extractor, select Rebuild BIG. Select the folder that you were working in.  
Save the file in the folder that held the original .big file. Sometimes this program crashed when  
rebuilding, I have found that to reduce that crash you rename the file so it saves as a new file rather  
than overwrite the original one. There is still a chance the rebuild can crash. If it does, simply try it  
again with a new name.  
Once it is done, you should see this  
If your new file has a file size of 0, there was an error in rebuilding the .big file. Try to do it again.  
If it has worked, simply delete the original file and rename your file to be the same as the original.  
Done! Check it out in-game!  
Remember that this was the first of two files to replace. The other one is in playerheadssmall. It is  
what is used in the actual game, not in the menus. You have to go through these same steps to  
replace that one, as the file size is different.","['Thank you for your post to /r/automation!\n     \nNew here?

Preprocessing documents before sending to IDP,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/xjgm4u/preprocessing_documents_before_sending_to_idp/,automation,"At my last job we implemented ABBYY to speed up document processing and it worked for most documents but not all. In the end we ended up using the following workflow:

1. All invoice submissions went to QA first who validated the document type (and if it was clean etc.)
2. If it was a doc that was good for ABBYY they would send it there.
3. Otherwise bookkeeping would handle it themselves.

This worked but ruined the point of going to IDP since inevitably we would get a backlog and it wasn't uncommon to have crap documents in there anyways.

After talking around with other people it seems like this is not an uncommon scenario. I've been exploring a (really dumb?) idea to do a quick preprocessing on documents (<10s) to just evaluate:

* is this a legible, valid document submission?
* what type of document does it look like?

And then either send it back to the submitter if it is a bad doc, or pass it on to the right bucket if its good.

So, it this a useful idea? If you do IDP, do you also have a person in the loop for that first validation step?

Any and all thoughts are welcome, especially if I'm the only one that dealt with this problem. Also, if you want to try out what I've got so far PM me.

Automate Progress Reports for Teacher?,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/x9yzbt/automate_progress_reports_for_teacher/,automation,"Greetings All. My wife is a teacher, and her school requires teachers to do weekly progress reports for their students. Last night I was helping her set up this year's forms (63 total), which involved inputting the student's name, the appropriate teacher's name, and the date. Unfortunately, this is a largely manual process, requiring her to manually tally the number of missing assignments and transpose the details for each into its appropriate box on the form on a weekly basis (this eats up between 2 and 3 hours, since she has to switch back and forth between pages). She commented that she wished this sort of project could be automated, and it got me thinking about options. Unfortunately, her school is cheap as hell and will not invest in any gradebook applications (they rely solely on G-Suite, using a shared Google Sheets workbook for grade tracking (I know, lol)). 

What I would like to do is come up with a way to automatically fill in the student's details to the form (right now it is a Google Doc with crazy formatting, would love to move it to Word or PDF it but I need to maintain compatibility with G-Suite), date the form, and then tally the number of assignments missing for each class and load it into the  appropriate box on the form. Then I would need to automatically save the output so it is ready to print, while maintaining an archive of the file.

I used to work for a company that used a program that ran VBS scripts to generate the day's reports in a variety of formats (some Word, some Excel, a couple of PDFs). Ideally I would love to do something similar. However, I am learning as I go. So, I am curious what everyone would recommend for achieving this goal (e.g. do I need a program, do I just need scripts, what language, etc.). My hope is to give her an option that scrapes the master gradebook on command and carries the data to another spreadsheet (in case any students are added later we won't have to tweak the program), then carries over the student's data to the appropriate fields, then looks at the line of grades and reports on number of missing assignments (they score 0-4, with 0 being missing and anything 1 or above being turned in, so this should be a simple item to report on). The output would then export as either an editable document, a PDF, or both. If anyone has any external sites that they would recommend I research, please post the links! I'm not looking for everyone to do this for me, I just need an idea of where to start. Thanks!","['It could be easily done by existing G-suite account.. with the help of Google apps script .\nGoogle sheet , doc, pdf, auto email etc can be easily possible.', 'I‘m pretty sure this can be done with Python not too complicated, it may be finnacy to get the data out of the doc, but maybe you can export that as csv and run over that.', 'Python can, but if you are not a developer, look into Microsoft Power Automate.

3. Navigate with several clicks to a ""export"" button that opens the window ""select where to download this file"" (this is not a link to the file, is a button).

# Tips 
- Pass variable to the locator  
In this sample channel name is passed to the `matched_result_span` locator as following
  - Define variable in locator  
   ![](imgs/pass_variable.png)  
  -  Pass variable in code
      ```python
      matched_result_span=clicknium.wait_appear(locator.websites.app_slack.matched_result_span,{""channel_name"": channel_name})
      ```
- Use wildcard in locator  
In this sample `channel_sort_btn` locator's sInfo is updated end with * as following

# Steps

1. Assume Twitter is not open in chrome, so we need open chrome with the explore address firstly.  
   ```python
   #Use following code to open chrome with target url
   browser_tab=clicknium.chrome.open(""https://twitter.com/explore"") 
   ```
2. Assume Twitter is not signed in, so we need to sign in twitter with Google account or twitter account.  
![](https://github.com/automation9417/automation-samples/raw/main/ScrapingPeopleRecentTweets/imgs/sign_in_twitter.png)
  - Google account sign in
    ```python

Automated Temperature for Bearded Dragon Enclosure,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/wh96b0/automated_temperature_for_bearded_dragon_enclosure/,automation,"Hey guys,

I'm wondering what it would take to be able to basically have the perfect temperature inside my reptile enclosure all the time.

I don't know a lot about this stuff but basically..a bearded dragons enclosure should kinda have 3 zones.

A cooler side, a warm middle side, and then a hotter side where he would usually bask in more powerful light/UV.

What I would like to do is have maybe a sensor for the cool side and the hottest side and depending on the temps it would dim the light/turn it up and for the cool side if too cold it could turn on a ceramic heat emitter and adjust it up or down in power.

How hard would this be to do? And how would one go about it? Thanks","[""You can absolutely do this with an Arduino and a few sensors and relays. You could go down the road of analog current control through circuitry, but it's easier to just turn your heaters and uv lamps on/off based on set points. Best combination of simple and cheap for this kind of thing would be DHT11 sensors for temp and relays to control your heaters. An Arduino Uno is well enough equipped to handle everything, but if you want to add an lcd you'll probably want a mega 2560. There's really a ton of things you can do with this, including remote control via a WiFi board and MQTT."", 'Thank you for your post to /r/automation!\n     \nNew here?

Clicknium Automation Sample Solution - Data Migration,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/wfwvul/clicknium_automation_sample_solution_data/,automation,"Many enterprises need data migration solution. For example, if IT system is upgraded,there is need to migrate data from legacy system to upgraded system. This is a sample for employee data migration solution with[Clicknium](https://www.clicknium.com/) desktop&web automation. Here is the details: migrate employee data from a legacy thick client application into new HR system. The manual steps are as the follows:

* query data from legacy client app based on employee id.
* query more meta data of employee through internal REST API.
* fill the data of employee to the new HR system(web portal).

# Run this sample

* follow [clicknium getting started](https://www.clicknium.com/documents/quickstart) to set up develop environment.
* clone this sample repo
* download and unzip [legacy thick client app](https://github.com/AutomationAnywhere/Employee-Data-Migration/raw/master/EmployeeList.zip) to local repo folder.
* clone [sample repo](https://github.com/clicknium/clicknium-samples).

&#8203;

    git clone https://github.com/clicknium/clicknium-samples.git 

* open the folder 'EmployeeDataMigration' in Visual Studio Code
* through pipinstall the dependent packages

requestsis used to query data through internal REST api.

    pip install requests 

* open app.pyin Visual Studio Code .
* press F5to debug the sample or CTRL+F5to run the sample. You will see the result as below:

https://preview.redd.it/4kkbpsyo1of91.png?width=522&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6402101b350919763c67b1d00f041b6e135705a9

# The Purpose of the Sample

* open the legacy client application with subprocess module, and it will be used to query data later.

&#8203;

    current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) employeeList_exe = os.path.join(current_dir, ""EmployeeList.exe"") process = subprocess.Popen(employeeList_exe) 

* open the browser with Clicknium python module and open new HR system. In this sample microsoft edge browser will be used.

&#8203;

    tab = cc.edge.open(""https://developer.automationanywhere.com/challenges/automationanywherelabs-employeedatamigration.html"") 

When the browser is opened, it will return to the edge tab/page.

* get the employee id in new HR system with Clicknium web automaton

&#8203;

    employee_id = tab.find_element(locator.employeedatamigration.developer.text_employeeid).get_text() 

* based on the captured employee\_id above, find the employee information on legacy client application with Clicknium desktop automation.

&#8203;

    cc.ui(locator.employeedatamigration.employee.edit_txtempid).set_text(employee_id, by='set-text')
    cc.ui(locator.employeedatamigration.employee.button_btnsearch).click(by='control-invocation')
    item[""first_name""] = cc.ui(locator.employeedatamigration.employee.edit_txtfirstname).get_text()
    item[""last_name""] = cc.ui(locator.employeedatamigration.employee.edit_txtlastname).get_text()
    item[""email_id""] = cc.ui(locator.employeedatamigration.employee.edit_txtemailid).get_text()
    item[""city""] = cc.ui(locator.employeedatamigration.employee.edit_txtcity).get_text()
    ... ...

automatically set text for employee\_id and click search button to capture all information such as first\_name, last\_name etc of this employee In desktop application operation,Clicknium uses mouse&keyboard simulation by default . In this legacy application, the input and button control support control invocation, so we can use it by pass parameter byin click and set\_text api.

* through requestsmodule, send http request to get the extra information(phone number, start date ) of the employee.

&#8203;

    response = requests.get(api_url + employee_id)
    print(datetime.datetime.now().strftime(""%H:%M:%S"") + "" get response"")
    obj = json.loads(response.content.decode('UTF-8'))
    item[""phoneNumber""] = obj[""phoneNumber""]
    item[""startDate""] = obj[""startDate""]

* fill the data into new HR system through clicknium web automation.

&#8203;

    tab.find_element(locator.employeedatamigration.developer.text_firstname).set_text(item[""first_name""])
    tab.find_element(locator.employeedatamigration.developer.text_lastname).set_text(item[""last_name""])
    tab.find_element(locator.employeedatamigration.developer.text_phone).set_text(item[""phoneNumber""])
    tab.find_element(locator.employeedatamigration.developer.text_email).set_text(item[""email_id""])
    ... ...
    tab.find_element(locator.employeedatamigration.developer.button_submitbutton).click()

In code above, you can see:

* The locator is separated from code , so the locator store can be managed independently. If the new HR system is upgradeD, the locator will changed and the locator store will be updated as well.
* As Clicknium provides unified API for both desktop and web automation, you can write automation code in the same way for browser and windows application.

# Locator

The [Locator](https://www.clicknium.com/documents/concepts/locator) is the identifier of UI element , which can be recorded or edited with [clicknium vs code extension ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ClickCorp.clicknium).

In this sample, you can open the locator in Visual Studio Code , for example:

https://preview.redd.it/jhpfwk7v1of91.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8a4675d5acb9b5b35838548a8be0ccb8f62476e1

# Compare with Selenium & Playwright

* The web driver needs to be downloaded in Selenium matching exactly the browser . In this example, the Edge browser version is 103.0.1264.62, so there is a need to download the same version MS Edge web driver first.
* Selenium and playwright can only support web automation. So when it comes to employee data migration solution, you can operate on the legacy client app by using another library such as pywinauto.

# What the sample do

* open the testing CRM web portal.
* get the url of CSV to be download.
* download the CSV file .

&#8203;

    tab = cc.edge.open(""https://developer.automationanywhere.com/challenges/automationanywherelabs-customeronboarding.html"")
    url = tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.a_downloadcsv).get_property(""href"")
    excelFile = requests.get(url)
    temp_file = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'missing.csv')
    open(temp_file, 'wb').write(excelFile.content)
    data = pd.read_csv(temp_file)

* iterate the records and fill the data into CRM system and register the customer.

&#8203;

    for idx, item in data.iterrows():
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.text_customername).set_text(item[0])
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.text_customerid).set_text(item[1])
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.text_primarycontact).set_text(item[2])
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.text_street).set_text(item[3])
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.text_city).set_text(item[4])
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.select_state).select_item(item[5])
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.text_zip).set_text(""%05d"" % item[6])
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.email_email).set_text(item[7])
    if item[8] == ""YES"":
        tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.radio_activediscountyes).set_checkbox()
    else:
        tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.radio_activediscountno).set_checkbox()
            
    if item[9] == ""YES"":
        nda = 'check'
    else:
        nda = 'uncheck'
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.checkbox_nda).set_checkbox(check_type=nda)
    tab.find_element(locator.customeronboarding.developer.button_submit_button).click()

From above code , you can see:

* Locator is separate from code , so locator store can be managed independently, if the CRM system is upgrade, locator is changed, just need update the locator store.
* Easy to select option from dropdown list: tab.find\_element(<locator>).select\_item(<option>)
* Easy to check radio button/checkbox: tab.find\_element(<locator>).set\_checkbox()

# Locator

[Locator](https://www.clickcorp.com/documents#automation/locator) is the identifier of UI element, through [clicknium vs code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ClickCorp.clicknium) can record/edit the locator.

# Compare with Selenium

* Selenium need download the webdriver which version should exactly match the browser , in this example, my Edge browser version is 103.0.1264.62  
, so I need download the same version msedge web driver first.
* Selenium does not support check operation for radion button, need use click instead.

&#8203;

    driver.find_element('id', 'activeDiscountYes').click() 

* To select option from dropdown list, need import additional class to wrapper.

&#8203;

    from selenium.webdriver.support.select import Select
    Select(driver.find_element('id', 'state')).select_by_value(item[5])

* Compare the running time In this sample, need fill 7 records, each record need submit 10 fields. From the log, we can see clicknium is more faster than selenium.

Clicknium Automation Sample Solution - Finance Quarter Close,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/wa4x9r/clicknium_automation_sample_solution_finance/,automation,"For many enterprises, at the end of each fiscal quarter, the finance team spends much time making all of the financial obligations fulfilled. This is a sample of financial quarter close solution with [clicknium](https://www.clicknium.com/) automation. It can review transactions automatically. Here is the details: go through transactions in local financial system to find the matching transaction in the Bank system. If the match is found, change the `Transaction Status` to `Verified` in local financial system.

The manual steps are as follows:

* login to local financial system.
* Query the transactions in this quarter.
* login to the bank system.
* For each transaction:
   * based on `Payment Account`, navigate to corresponding page.
   * search 'Payment Amount'.
   * If the matched one is found, go back to local financial system, set the `Transaction Status` to Verified.
* After all transactions are reviewed, click `Submit` button in local financial system.

# Run this sample

* follow [clicknium getting started](https://www.clicknium.com/documents/quickstart) to set up develop environment.
* clone [sample repo](https://github.com/clicknium/clicknium-samples).

&#x200B;

    git clone https://github.com/clicknium/clicknium-samples.git

* open the folder 'QuarterCloseChallenge' in Visual Studio Code
* open `app.py` in Visual Studio Code.
* press `F5` to debug the sample or press `CTRL+F5` to run sample. You will see the result as below:

https://preview.redd.it/i18q40trz9e91.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3315e7f70fd65c47dd2945f1fb1e399c60138187

# The Purpose of The Sample

* open local financial system to get the transaction count and scrape `Amount` and `Account` information for each transaction.

&#x200B;

    def get_transaction_count():
        transaction = []
        tab = cc.edge.open(""https://developer.automationanywhere.com/challenges/automationanywherelabs-quarterclose.html"", is_wait_complete=True, timeout=60)
        if tab.is_existing(locator.quaterclose.developer.button_onetrust_accept_btn_handler):
            tab.find_element(locator.quaterclose.developer.button_onetrust_accept_btn_handler).click()
        elems1 = tab.find_elements(locator.quaterclose.developer.text_paymentaccount)
        elems2 = tab.find_elements(locator.quaterclose.developer.text_paymentamount)
        count = len(elems1)
        for i in range(count):
            account = elems1[i].get_text()
            amount = elems2[i].get_text()
            transaction.append({""Amount"":amount, ""Account"":account, ""Status"":""Unverified""})
        return tab,transaction

Here we leverage Clicknium `find_elements` api to find all similar elements. For example, for element's locator of PO number:

https://preview.redd.it/iwtuqyo20ae91.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4d422b71810d7ee5fe8e1f81577365564df8297a

To record similar elements, you can click `Similar elements` in Clicknium Recorder:

https://preview.redd.it/02rzux140ae91.png?width=337&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e92a68cb8f7e1df879d923541da15a1c94c392f0

The wizard will be shown as below:

You can record (`Ctrl`\+click) two or more elements, for example:

https://preview.redd.it/yt4gaoq70ae91.png?width=1153&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=80057d8e07bc4ef0e8be74140716299e012593e4

It will show the counts of matched elements:

* open bank system and login
* iterate the transactions and go to the corresponding account page based on each transaction's account
* search the transaction's amount, and if the matched one is found, mark the transaction state as Verified.

                item[""Status""] = ""Verified""
        bank_tab.close()

* go back to local financial system and  batch update transactions state.

&#x200B;

    def update_transaction_status(tab: BrowserTab, transaction):
        elems = tab.find_elements(locator.quaterclose.developer.select_status)

        tab.find_element(locator.quaterclose.developer.button_submitbutton).click()

# Locator

The [Locator](https://www.clicknium.com/documents/tutorial/locator) is the identifier of UI element, which can be recorded and edited with [clicknium vs code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ClickCorp.clicknium).

# Compare with Playwright

* You need to write xpath to get similar elements.

&#x200B;

    elems1 = page.query_selector_all(""//*[contains(@id,'PaymentAccount')]"")
    elems2 = page.query_selector_all(""//*[contains(@id,'PaymentAmount')]"")

* You need to fill the text to search the transaction item by pressing Enter as well.

&#x200B;

    bank_page.locator(""[placeholder=\""Search\\.\\.\\.\""]"").fill(item[""Amount""])
    bank_page.press(""[placeholder=\""Search\\.\\.\\.\""]"",'Enter')

How to automate random pixel filling?,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/w2kjbd/how_to_automate_random_pixel_filling/,automation,"Hey folks,

I’m trying to put together a fun activity for my office. I’ll spare you the unnecessary details, so here’s what I need:

I want a way of randomly filling in a specified grid if pixels, and I’d like to be able to have this operation generate and save multiple files.

Think of it like a QR code, with a 6x6 grid of pixels — so six pixels in length, and six pixels in width (meaning: a total area of 36 pixels). I’m looking for a way to generate a random assortment of combinations, and save each result (be it png, jpeg, pdf, etc).

Is there an easy way to do this? Ideally, I’d like to use 6 different colors, but I can figure that part out myself if I can just get some guidance on randomly generating the pixels. Thanks!","['Is this a programming question? What are you working with? You spared a bit too many “unnecessary details”. If you have the structure set up just iterate through each pixel and use a random function in whatever language you’re using to determine the color.\n\nEdit: you could use the RANDBETWEEN function in excel to generate random numbers, and then use those numbers with conditional formatting to make a coloured grid.

Automating a way to fill out a form in a desktop app,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/w0lgp0/automating_a_way_to_fill_out_a_form_in_a_desktop/,automation,"The majority of my job is reading through technical reports of product failures, and filling out an assessment form (open text, dropdowns, radio buttons, etc) based on the information. Essentially I am making an assessment of the report. The open text portions of the forms are mostly things I can copy and paste from previous templates, with some slight modifications needed here and there. However the radio buttons and drop downs change depending on the type of report I’m reviewing. 

An example would be:
I have a report for test results which specify that the test failed due to user error. I would then use that report to complete the assessment form and check all the right boxes and enter the correct text needed to summary the issue.  

All of these reports and forms are housed in a proprietary desktop app on MacOS. 

I would like to automate this process to increase efficiency because my team process hundreds of these every week. 

Big disclaimer: I am not a programmer, but I am an engineer. 

Can anyone recommend an automated solution where I can basically just select the type of report I received and it somehow populates the entire form for me based on my selection? 
I assume it would need some type of script where I can pre-populate the form entries, but I have no clue how to do this. 

Using my previous example, perhaps the script could ask me what type of report I received, then I could select “testing-user error” and it would populate everything I need into the assessment form.

Any way to automate iTunes downloads on Windows?,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/vrr5ed/any_way_to_automate_itunes_downloads_on_windows/,automation,"I have a very large list of apps I would like backups of. It's somewhat deprecated, but Apple still lets you download .ipa files of apps in iTunes [12.6.5.3](https://12.6.5.3) on Windows 10 for people who want more control over app installation. I've created links that look like, for example:

itms://apps.apple.com/us/app/mobilefuge/id503610940?uo=4

I put the links into an html file I can open in a browser, and when I click on a link, the app's page opens in iTunes. Then I click a button in iTunes that says ""Get"", and it downloads to my PC. Rinse and repeat. Occasionally iTunes prompts me to re-enter my password, which I paste in and click OK.

This works, but it's incredibly tedious. Does anyone have suggestions for how I could automate this process? If it was all in a browser I could probably figure it out, but I've never done anything with automating a random program.

I actually found a program that says it does exactly what I want on Mac, but iTunes 12.6.5.3 won't run in recent mac OS's. It uses the JXA framework for OSX.

Before we can answer the question why the Helpmate project has failed we have to answer, if this was the case. It seems, that there a different opinions available if a hospital robot makes sense or not. The idea from the manufacturing company was, that a robot can do repetitive tasks much faster and at lower costs and this makes a robot a good choice to automate something. The counter argument is, that robots won't improve the productivity because they are too complicated to use.

Checking University Website,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/vl85cq/checking_university_website/,automation,"Hi all, 

i want to automate to check if there is any change on website of my university.

I have tries many many MANY ways but nothing works so i am writing this here after many failed attempts.

I am trying to automate checking if there are any new notifications on my university website. I need to go to It's page ([https://university.com/Index.jsp?)](https://university.com/Index.jsp?)) and to login with my credentials and then i am greeted with my profile on their webisode ([https://university.com/StudentIndex.jsp?)](https://university.com/StudentIndex.jsp?)) where i can see if there are any new notifications. I have made selenium script that basically goes to that website, takes screenshot and compare it to an image i have took when there are no new notifications. If they are not the same, there are notifications and via versa. Easy! But when i want to put that script on my Raspberry Pi it doesn't work. I don't have X on there so selenium doesn't like it. I have tried with all sorts of modules (PyVirtualDisplay,...) but everything just make my RPI(3B) freeze and nothing. Ok so i have gone in another direction. I looked at wget and curl. But problem is UNI website has bad ssl. Ok --no-check-certification does the work, but still it wouldn't get pass login page. Ok then i have tried with cookies which i get when i log in, but wget says [https://university.com/Index.jsp](https://university.com/Index.jsp)? does not exist but [https://university.com](https://university.com) does, but if you go there there is no login. WTF. Ok then i have tried HTTrack but i am confused on how to add cookies to login ( i am on Linux Arch so i can use only cli version).

Ok that doesn't work as well, ok go look into another direction. I have tried to look for some website that does that, and there are some.Nice! But they are all paid, and if not paid they don't work. I don't know why, probably cause it is dynamic website and not static. 

Ok what about Android app? There are some but they too have a problem cause it is dynamic. 

And after many days and attempts i am writing this here. Does anyone know what should i do? How can i check If there are new notifications on uni website ?","['Thank you for your post to /r/automation!\n     \nNew here?

New house has an inground pool.  I'm very worried about drowning.  It was a complete no 5 or 10 years ago.  But the kids are getting older.  Our youngest is 8.  I'm mostly worried about her.  The others can swim well.  But, even a good swimmer can drown.  I bought a thing that floats in the pool that will alert if it detects waves.  But I look at that like it's the last line of defense.  Id like to know if the kids are walking by the pool.

They have driveway alarms that would ding, but id like to set it to arm when we're not outside at the pool and, if it detects motion, not to only give one quick ding like a car drove in.  I want it to get my attention.  

Also, the new house I can't hook up anything internet based.  I've scheduled to have satellite internet installed.  But there's a monthly data cap.  So I'm not hooking a whole bunch of smart devices like we do now.  I can't have something trickling the data 24x7 all month.  (Kind of looking forward to being more old school.)

Is iMacros still the best and simplest method of extracting text from one page and copying it to another?,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/ure0ki/is_imacros_still_the_best_and_simplest_method_of/,automation,"I always used to love creating iMacros for extracting the data from osTicket and copying it to whatever web tool that was required for that ticket. I know there is Selenium, ParseHub, WebHarvy, RPA UiVision, etc.

But is there anything else that is both simple and effective at copying data from one tab to another?

What I love about iMacros is the recording option. You can just record it and edit what is needed after the fact. But it seems that iMacros is quite out-dated and has fallen under new ownership. Also, the fact that I lost all of my iMacros while I was on medical leave to remove my voice box (full laryngectomy because of esophageal cancer). Also, RPA UIVision doesn't seem compatible with a lot of elements, and iMacros has the same issue.

So before I start remaking these, is there something similar or better? I have a free lifetime subscription to ParseHub, which is amazing, but lacks the copy and paste function. I also reverse-engineered Webharvy to bypass activation, but I can't have that on company systems.

2. Support for pytest with selenium, appium, playwright tool

3. Flaky test detection logic

4. Number of tests does not impact the overall runtimes too much because cloud scales for you

Right now I am using VScode to write in and run when I have several that are ""ready"", but that kinda defeats what I am looking for. Is there an editor that I can run that will keep Chrome open and that I can add text to as I go?

General advice on setting up tests,https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/109gvcx/general_advice_on_setting_up_tests/,selenium,"Hello! I am pretty new to testing and Selenium and I feel as though I'm *not getting it*. 

I'm currently building an e-commerce portfolio app with Django; right now I have my accounts app set up to register new users, log them in/out, and delete their accounts. Presumably I'd like to test all those features in a script: load my app, create a new user, log that new user in, log them out, delete the account.

I've encountered a countless number of technical difficulties even performing one of these tasks. I've found the official documentation to be contradictory and confusing (maybe it's just me); every tutorial I've found so far has used outdated syntax and only delves into the most uselessly superficial tasks (loading a URL and that's it).

So I'd like some advice on where to go to figure out what the process is for testing what I'm aiming to test. **What's the general strategy for setting up these tests**? Are there any up-to-date resources available that focus on more useful testing processes?

For a specific example of a problem I'm encountering: how does one handle loading a different page during the test? I have been able to register a new user; on clicking ""submit,"" it takes them to a login page. How do I wait for the new login page to load before continuing? Implicitly waiting doesn't seem to do anything, but `time.sleep()` does.

Even if someone has a link to a repo that includes some tests in Python (especially if it's Django!) would be wonderful to see. I learn by example pretty well. Thanks for any advice.","['This is a hard one to answer, as there aren’t any specific problems posed.  \n\nFor the redirect to the new page, you are on the right track.  As a general rule I would be using a selenium wait on the WebElement that I was looking to use on the new page.\n\nThe general strategy may vary depending on tech used.  Currently I am using Cucumber with Selenium.  So I will write my test in Gherkin.  It’s BDD, so that fails, but with an error that tells me to implement the code.  I implement it and then write the next test.  All of my tests are independent, meaning that each test logs in, completes the test and logs out.  There is no dependency between tests.\n\nSome things you may want to look at (off the top of my head) are the selenium page object model, data injection to share your web driver, maybe a web driver factory if you are testing multiple browsers.\n\nI feel you.  The documentation you find around the web can be sparse, simple, and outdated, but it is out there.  Even what I have written here may be outdated as a newer version of Selenium has simplified the process of creating/using the webdriver.  I haven’t looked at that closely yet.']"
StaleElementReferenceException,https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/10900vs/staleelementreferenceexception/,selenium,"im using python3 selenium with firefox.

how can i avoid this particular exception? it seems like everytime i try to do a loop over elements i get this exception sooner or later.

&#x200B;

    data_and_resources_ul = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME,'resource-list')
    csv_or_tsv_total = data_and_resources_ul.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME,'format-label')
    for csv_or_tsv in csv_or_tsv_total:
            csv_or_tsv.click()
            time.sleep(1)
            navbar = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME,'tabs--primary')
            all_buttons = navbar.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME,'a')
            back_to_dataset = [a for a in all_buttons if a.get_attribute('href').endswith('dataset')]
            back_to_dataset[0].click()
            time.sleep(1)

this is my code csv\_or\_tsv.click() takes me to a new page so new url then i will add more code there after that i press back\_to\_dataset\[0\].click() takes me to the previous page where csv\_or\_tsv\_total exists.

so my for loop should not fail because the same elements where gathered in the first place when i was on that page initially.

the for loop crashes on second iteration with StaleElementReferenceException

how can i fix this?","[""In my experience stale element means the DOM has changed due to asynchronous loading, and/or elements being updated somehow.\n\nI don't know python at all, but try to do some sort of exception catching and then re-build your list of elements to keep it current."", ""This was asked yesterday.

This probably isn't the cleanest code anyone has seen but, currently I am looking for some help or even ideas.   This code I've made is a project for fun, reason why I made this is I like to travel and yes I get there are other things like Hopper and FlightTracker but wanted to try some things on my own.

&#x200B;

**Here is what the code does:** It goes to the [AA.com](https://AA.com) site > Searches for the airport I depart from and want to arrive > Enters in the travel dates > Searches for them > AA (Tells me the dates are incorrect) I tell it to hit the submit button again  and it works > Then it takes a screen shot of the  depart flight of the first half of the page, saves it in my downloads then  clicks on the first box because it is the cheapest > Then Takes a screenshot of a return flight and saves it to my download.

(I haven't put this code on reddit but if anyone wants it I can easily give it to them.)  The next steps are I have another script run a couple minutes after > Picks up the files I saved to my downloads > Attaches it to an email and then the email sends it to me)

&#x200B;

**What i'm trying to get help with is i'm trying to get rid of the old way screenshots and putting this info into an excel document, or even put text into an email with Flight number, Price, Date, Time... ETC but i've ran into a road block and i'm not even sure if this is possible. Would love some help if anyone has experience.**

I've got an error that keeps coming up in a variety of tests, seemingly at random. I'm sure it's not random, but I can't identify the pattern (and subsequently the fix).

For context I have 29 tests running on windows VMs through Azure DevOps. I've got it set to 10 threads (browsers) but I can change that.

>element.Click();

How do I wait for css selector to click?,https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/zlorlo/how_do_i_wait_for_css_selector_to_click/,selenium,"Hi, I have a monitoring script in Python + Selenium. Right now I use a lot of xpath and id to click and it is annoying because the frameworks used sometimes changes the id and xpath, so I would like to look for something that will stay the same for a longer time.

I figured CSS selector content could be nice, they seem to be named after what they really do in the application I monitor.

I tried to google it but I found no examples I understood how I could convert.

Right now my function looks like this, how can I modify that to use css selector?:

    def wait_for_xpath_click(params, element_xpath):
    	temp_element = WebDriverWait(browser, 60).until(
    		expected_conditions.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH, element_xpath))

How do I bulk add a bunch of commands to Selenium?,https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/ze7l5j/how_do_i_bulk_add_a_bunch_of_commands_to_selenium/,selenium,"I was using Excel & iMacros to do this before.  Basically, I have a list of employee ID #s that need to be clicked, by their Link ID (not by their name).  So for example, in iMacros I'd send the command:
TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=ID:Link_123456

In that example, the employee's ID # was 123456.

I'd have a whole list of IDs, so I'd just use excel to merge the ""123456"" with ""TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=ID:Link_"" to make ""TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=ID:Link_123456""

iMacros doesn't work anymore and has been discontinued.

In Selenium IDE, it would be:
Command ""click""
Targer ""id=Link_123456

That's what I'd need it to do.

Now, how do I bulk add a bunch of IDs for each one to be clicked?  Can I do it in excel and then import those commands to Selenium?

I don't have a whole picture btw. I have experience on scripting in Linux, and with networking. But the web is still an unexplored territory and I need to be able to write basic scripts that can access links, fill login details and retrieve data.

So it's used for automation and also for user testing (many companies use it to run regression testing on their apps/websites when doing updates or feature changes).\n\nThe selenium documentation is good, but your best bet is to try making a test script to do something simple (log in to website, click some stuff, submit a form, logout).

xpath breaking,https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/z3a4am/xpath_breaking/,selenium,"So, I have a python script that at some point needs to get information from a website.
Everything is fine when I try to get ellement a, but element b breaks. This element lies deeper in the html code. Nothing would work.
I did figure out that after passing the 4th div or so that was when the xpath broke. When playing around with the website it seems that is roughly where the html changes when you press certain buttons.
 I figure the website makes use of something akin to tabs, but nothing seems to reflect this in the html. (And the ""default"" tab is the one I need anyways)
I can't really share the html and in python I've tried practicaly any way to access it that might exist (with the exception of going through sibling elements, as any element that is somewhat close to it is also unreachable)

If you can, try to find the element through some other means like class name, id (though I reckon you would've done that already if that was an option), text, and so on. If you can get the parent element of the element you want more easily with something like id, class name, text, etc. try to get that and then use some other means to search for the element you want within that element.\n\nFor example I had once a button that had no unique identifier to go on. The text of the button was the same as many other buttons in the DOM, it had no id, and the class names also were identical to many other buttons. I tried using XPath at first, but since the button appeared on a form that was generated when a certain event happened, the XPath wasn't always the same. However I noticed that the form actually had some unique identifiers, so when I first searched for that element with the unique locator I was then able to just look for the button element from within that form element. Even though the locators were identical to other elements on the page, they was unique within the context of the parent element.\n\nHope any of this helps!"", 'I can understand that you cannot share html code here.

"Hey, scraping developers, I need your help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/yrg70d/hey_scraping_developers_i_need_your_help/,selenium,"Hey all, 

Are there any experienced scraping API’s tech-users (the tools like ScraperAPI, ScrapingBee, ScrapingBot, Zenrows, etc.)? Or just web scraping enthusiasts? I really need your help! 

My name is Alex, I am a scraping developer with a mission to build the best Proxy API tool out there (humble is not my way.)  So here is my project - [ScrapeIN’](https://scrapein.app/)  where I am trying to combine and automate the best practices for bypassing site protection and create all-in-one scraping infrastructure for any data engineer. 

I released the first MVP version of my Proxy API and want to make sure that it works as planned, so it would be awesome if you could help me out and test it for any issues and bugs. 

So to test my ScrapeIn you need to

1. Go [here](https://dashboard.scrapein.app/)
2. Register - it will allow you to use scraper for 14 days with 1000 credits. I can extend access on request if needed, just ping me here or in dms or by email. I don’t request credit card upon registration or anything, so don’t worry about the payment that supposedly should follow the trial😅
3. Look through our [API docs](https://dashboard.scrapein.app/docs) 
4. [Use ](https://dashboard.scrapein.app/)the API key given to you for scraping any public data from the web.  
5. [Use](https://dashboard.scrapein.app/query-builder) visual CSS selectors mode in order to extract the necessary data from a site accurately. 
6. Take and submit a short questionnaire Google [form](https://forms.gle/vbEaerevcoDjFNNc6).  
7. Enjoy increased ScrapeIN’ account balance by 1000 free credits! 

I really appreciate any of your feedback and thoughts about ScrapeIN’. Don’t hesitate to share with me any of your feedback in DMs or at support@scrapein.app.",['Bypassing site protections is the exact opposite of best practices.']

&#x200B;

I’m new to automated testing with Selenium and have some questions regarding the following that I want to accomplish.

\-	I want to define a generic Xpath within the Action (Helper location), that I can reuse for several fields on the web-application form page.

\-	Basically I want to find the class element that I have written down in Step 2 and fill the k-textbox with a value by using the generic Xpath from Step 1.

&#x200B;

The below example is not working for me and I guess I have messed it up, would be nice If someone could provide me with an example. Thanks!

&#x200B;

Step1:

My current generic Xpath within the Action (Helper location), that I want use for several fields on the webpage form.

&#x200B;

Example what I got.

&#x200B;

public void SelectAndTypeEditFieldByLabelGeneric(string label, string searchtext)

{

TypeByXpath(""//\*\[contains(@class,'form-col') or contains(@class, 'form-input')\]//\*\[text()='"" + label + ""'\]/parent::div//input"", searchtext);

}

&#x200B;

Step 2:

From my steps location I fil in the input values with the reference toward the generic Xpath from step 1.

&#x200B;

Example what I got.

&#x200B;

\[When(@""I Fill In The Account Details"")\]

public void WhenIFillInTheAccountDetails(string label, string searchtext)

{

Action.SelectAndTypeEditFieldByLabelGeneric(""Bedrijfsnaam"", ""Test Company"");

Action.SelectAndTypeEditFieldByLabelGeneric(""Straat"", ""Test Street"");

Action.SelectAndTypeEditFieldByLabelGeneric(""Huisnummer"", ""999"");

    }  

Furthermore the When condition here has a relation with the SpecFlowFeature for the scenario.

&#x200B;

Scenario: Add A New Account

    When I Fill In The Account Detail

EDIT: I found the issue and solved the problem.

I changed: 

public void SelectAndTypeEditFieldByLabelGeneric(string label, string searchtext) With -> 'public void WhenIFillInTheAccountDetailsTest() .  

And within Action I changed the string searchtext with string value

public void SelectAndTypeEditFieldByLabelGeneric(string label, string searchtext)

{

My script is pretty fast so I don't know if it's so fast it crashes, because if I debug the program it runs completly normal and doesn't crash. This is the code I've newly written (and I feel like the error is coming from):

        def find_element_selenium(self, by, name):
            return WebDriverWait(self.driver, TIMEOUT).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((by, name)))

            return WebDriverWait(self.driver, TIMEOUT).until(EC.presence_of_all_elements_located((by, name)))
    
        def load_new_page(self, url):

What I've written so far is able to click through the ""basic"" button and the ""matchups"" button, but the request to click the ""show numbers"" button always times out unless I give the full XPATH as the locator. I think that it could be that the condition ""element\_to\_be\_clickable"" is not met because an ad covers the button so it isn't visible, however I don't think that explains why it works when I supply the full XPATH.

I think I've figured out the issue. There are two elements on the site with ID ""showNumbers"" which is curious site design and I'm still not sure the best way to work around this.

         else:                 
              clickedSquares.append(random_square)

To fix this issue I added the **if not winner** condition  where ""winner"" is a string. This does terminate the loop; however, I'm  getting an error as soon as the checkForWinner() function is called  because winnerOh is always false. 

    winnerOh = WebDriverWait(load_browser, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH, Tags.resultOh)))         
    
    winnerEx = WebDriverWait(load_browser, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH, Tags.resultEx)))         
    
    tiedGame = WebDriverWait(load_browser, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH, Tags.resultTie)))

 I'm looking for an element on the UI that declares the winner: X or O or  tie, which will only appear if the game is over.  So  WebDriverWait().until() is timing out waiting for that element to  appear, but it hasn't yet, because it's only the second move in the  game. 

I'm not sure how to fix this issue. If I remove the call to  checkForWinner() the bot will get stuck in the recursive call to  test\_playTTT(). The browser will not close after the game is over, and  the test will not end successfully.

**Is there another way to check the UI for the element I'm looking for that won't immediately return a False condition?  Is there a  better way for me to write this for loop?**

Locator Strategy for Shadow Elements,https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/xxgu96/locator_strategy_for_shadow_elements/,selenium,"Hi all,

I have a scenario where a shadow element has different HTML tags on each environment. I am trying to use a single locator to locate the element in each environment, but it seems undoable.

The scenario is like the following:

The element can be located in lower environments like this 👇

`document.querySelector('validSelector1').shadowRoot.querySelector('validSelector2').shadowRoot.querySelector('validSelector3');`

The element can be located in the prod environment like this 👇

`document.querySelector('validSelector1').shadowRoot.querySelector('notValidSelector2').shadowRoot.querySelector('validSelector3');`

So the second selector will not be valid in prod. Is there a way to create a method to ignore the shadow host that is not present in the HTML and move to the next present shadow host? I want to avoid creating duplicate locators for the same element if it is doable. I really appreciate any help you can provide.",[]

Selenium is a free (open source) automated testing tool for validating web applications across a variety of browsers and platforms. You can use multiple programming languages like Java, C#, Python, etc to create Selenium Test Scripts.

2. Selenium Remote Control (RC)
3. Selenium WebDriver
4. Selenium Grid

It isn't looking great doing the same thing three times, which is why I tried to make a function, but I have encountered issues.

First issue is that I am unsure how to give the function a variable that it should then add the minutes to. activity_spent for example, it doesn't seem to add the time when I call the function giving it the variable time_read or time_programmed, even though these variables exist already, or even if they don't.

Second issue is that I now need multiple different elements from the same one for two or three activities, walking, running and hiking. Here I want more than simply time, now I need the distance and maybe heart rate as well. 

Third issue, and last one, is that the next step would be to summarize the time spent that day in some creative format, maybe there is a library that can summarize it into a banner, that I then can use for the twitter bot? I will have to look into it.

Then fixing all the explicit waits to something better of course.

"Chrome, Linux, headless, using client certificates",https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/xjgz2a/chrome_linux_headless_using_client_certificates/,selenium," 

I am having a problem passing my test user's PKI certificates in the headless mode. I am using Java Selenium WebDriver 4.3.0. When I run my test suite in normal mode, my profile and certificates are picked up perfectly. Profile users are selected by the ChromeOptions class by identifying the --user-data-dir= . I have different profiles for each of my test users. Then the certificate is selected by the policy setting (i.e, AutoSelectCertificateForUrls). That also works perfectly. As I navigate to different URL locations my test certificates are presented and accepted correctly when I run in the normal mode.

When I change the mode to Headless=true (i.e., ChromeOptions.addArguents(""--headless""), it all falls apart and no certificate is presented when I open a Chrome browser and hit any webpage.

I found that Firefox was extremely simple to manage profiles and PKI test certificates!!! When a test runs in normal mode and works perfectly, all I have to do is set the FirefoxOptions.addCommandLineOptions(""--headless""); and it still works perfectly in the headless mode. Not so with Chrome!!!

Does anyone know the correct solution? I could use the information. I am really stuck here.... Is there a way to still make Chrome present PKI certificates in headless mode or does anyone know that this feature really does not work for Chrome/Chromium? Then I could stop wasting my time!

What is selenium automation testing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/xj51f3/what_is_selenium_automation_testing/,selenium,"Automation testing is the process of executing a set of predefined tests over and over again in a rapid and repeatable way, ensuring that they are always up-to-date. Automation testing dramatically reduces the need for manual testing, allowing you to focus on more important work. It also makes executing tests faster and allowed for more frequent testing.

Selenium is an open source test automation framework written in Java. It supports various browsers and provides support for various testing frameworks such as JUnit, TestNG. Selenium uses different software called drivers to control the browser.

Some of the reasons behind its popularity are as follows:

1) Tests can be written in various programming languages.

2) Tests can be run in different operating systems.

3) It supports any browser that is available.

4) It can integrate with other software frameworks like TestNG and JUnit for project management and reporting purposes.",[' Thank you']

	time_read += result.tm_min

```

So this is my current code. It finds the date, checks if it is today and adds the minutes to the variable time_read. 

Now I need some help in how I go about adding multiple elements, and if this can be done with some kind of for loop, where it loops between the dates and can then extract the time from the element?

Do I need to set them up one by one, since I need to provide which element a specific iteration needs to pull from? So maybe I should have 5 or 6 checks for example, instead of some kind of loop that goes through and does it? Then it will be a lot of manual work, which makes me question if there isn't a better way to deal with it.

I do not want to use CSV.


Some relevant HTML
```
<div class=""pull-left activity-date date-col"">
        <span class=""unit"">Sep 14</span>
        <span class=""label"">2022</span>

After following some steps I get an error while testing. These are the steps that I followed: So first i initialize npm environment on windows: mkdir node\_testing cd node\_testing npm init -y npm install selenium-webdriver

then I installed chromedriver (105.0.5195.52) for chrome version 105.0.5195.102 (not the exact same version because there isn't one). I also added the chromedrivers path to system paths.

After that im asked to run the following code as a test but it results in an error:

`const webdriver = require('selenium-webdriver'),`  
 `By = webdriver.By,`  
 `until = webdriver.until;`

How to save a xpath attribute list to a variable?,https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/xe3ifp/how_to_save_a_xpath_attribute_list_to_a_variable/,selenium,"Hi, just a quick question: How to save a xpath href attribute list to a variable?

The html code is:

<div class=""title\\\\\\\_container"">    


<a target=""\\\\\\\_blank"" href=""\\\[https://link.com\\\](https://link.com)"">    


Im using

prop\_url = driver.find\_elements(By.XPATH, '//div\[@class=""title\_container""\]\[1\]/a')

To find the url.

I can confirm this is correct because i can print this and i get the list:

for p in prop\_url:print(p.get\_attribute('href'))

But i dont need to print this list, i need to save it to a variable so i can create a dictionary afterwards.

I tried

prop\_url\_strings = prop\_url.\_\_getattribute\_\_('href')

print(prop\_url\_strings)

And im getting this error:

prop\_url\_strings = prop\_url.\_\_getattribute\_\_('href')

AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'href'

&#x200B;

Can someone help me fix this please.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

EDIT: nm i got it:

prop\_url\_links=\[\]  
for pu in prop\_url:  
prop\_url\_links.append(pu.get\_attribute('href'))

 Selenium is free and an open source tool that provides an API for web developers to provide a language-independent method for writing tests. The underlying framework allows users to write test scripts in various programming languages like Java, Ruby or any other language. You can even use JSON, XML or any other data formats with Selenium without having to learn complex programming languages.

Webdriver + Tkinter Singleton-esque pattern,https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/x1t1fq/webdriver_tkinter_singletonesque_pattern/,selenium,"Hi, so I’m still pretty new to webdriver and wondering if this design pattern might be a solution to my problem. Generally I try to avoid singleton but it seems to make sense here, unless I’m misunderstanding how the driver actually works.

I’ve been building out a python tkinter gui to use with webdriver for my company, which helps my coworkers avoid many of the various tedious tasks associated with an ancient front end of an internal web app. Naturally, the buttons and other widgets’ commands need to call on webdriver in some fashion. 

Rather than lump everything into a single script, I’ve been developing this gui with classes and separating components into relevant modules. My selenium code is fashioned in the same way and I’ve been trying to implement it in an OOP manner and observe the POM as best as possible. 

The only solution that comes to mind is to implement the driver as a singleton. Instead of passing it around all my page objects and components and trying to make it work with tkinter’s event loop at the same time, I just create the single driver instance, and each of my page objects just get this driver as an arg. Due to python’s annoying import behavior, I can’t just import the single driver instance into all of my page objects, so I have to settle for passing this driver into page objects in wrapper functions bound to tkinter command attributes.

From google, I’ve been able to come up with this cobbled together code:

```
class WebdriverInstance:
    __driver__ = None

Is VS Code a good IDE/text editor to create a selenium framework in?,https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/wxxehn/is_vs_code_a_good_idetext_editor_to_create_a/,selenium,"To give you all some context of why i am asking this:

I'm currently trying to create the same POM-based selenium webdriver framework for multiple programming languages (Java, C#, Python, and JavaScript). I am doing this so that when it comes to interviews based around Selenium, i will well-prepped and language agnostic since i've already got a Selenium template good to go for whatever language that company uses. I figured that JS, Java, C#, & Python were the most commonly-used languages when it comes to Selenium.

Anyhow... I've noticed so far that VS code is a pain in the ass with Selenium in Java. I installed the Extension Pack for Java, and that seemed to have given me everything i need to run Java Code. I then was able to get selenium to run with the main method. And then soon after a bit of tinkering with TestNG, i was able to get my example test to run from my test method within my testNG test class.

&#x200B;

Heres the problem. When i run my TestNG tests from the test section of VS code (with the java extenion pack installed), the only meaningful failure output i see is that the test method failed. But it doesn't show me which specific assertion in my test method failed. This leads me to think that maybe VS Code isn't the best IDE/editor to run selenium code for Java? What do you all think? 

&#x200B;

I would PREFER to use VS code because that's the same IDE/text Editor that I use with [Cypress.io](https://Cypress.io) automation. But it seems like TestNG is either NOT meant to be run with VS Code at all or i need to use a completely different assertion library or something with VS Code to have an easier ""automation experience"". 

Does anyone have any suggestions on 1) Which IDE/text editor i should be using with Java Selenium. and 2) Any unit test libraries or extensions i could use that i'm not using here?

NOTE: I'm fully aware of Eclipse and jUnit, but i feel like that IDE is super old and crappy and JUnit doesn't have the same capabilities as TestNG.

Issue with pop-up window,https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/wvlqiw/issue_with_popup_window/,selenium,"Hi all...  


I've got an issue I'm struggling to solve using the Selenium Python library.  
I have one test setup and working fine, however my second test (which should be the same as the first) is failing due to an element, in fact any element, not being found on a pop-up window.

Here's what works in my working test (`main_page` is defined earlier in the script, and the `print(signin_window)` shows a different window handle to the main window):

`for handle in driver.window_handles:`  
 `if handle != main_page:`  
 `signin_window = handle`  
 `print(signin_window)`  
`try:`  
 `driver.switch_to.window(signin_window)`  
`except:`  
 `print(""Cannot switch to popup"")`  
`try:`

 `driver.find_element(By.ID, ""username"").send_keys(""myusername"")`  
 `driver.find_element(By.ID, ""password"").send_keys(""mypassword"")`  
 `driver.find_element(By.ID, ""login-submit"").click()`  
`except:`  
 `print(""Cannot Login"")`

The exception ""Cannot switch to popup"" does not print, so I guess that the new window is being selected, however the next stage fails.   
I've tried just adding `driver.find_element(By.ID, ""myMainDiv"")`instead, which is the popups main container, and it triggers the exception, so it seems it's not finding any elements on the popup at all.  
My first thought would be that it's not selected the popup as it can't find any of the elements, but as the popup exception doesn't trigger, I'm not sure thats the case  


Is there any other way of debugging this to make sure I'm on the correct window or am I missing something else?

Long term, I want to run a browser test, take a screenshot if there is a failure, and also send an email if any part of the test fails.  


I'm trying to understand if something exists in the Selenium library that would do this, or if this needs to be part of the Python script, if that makes sense?

Do I need to run each section of the test as a function of some sort, that will only continue if it passes?  
Do I need to look specifically at Python exception handling?  
Have I just answered my own question?  


Literally any pointers would be useful, apologies for my n00bness.","['https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_try_except.asp\n\nTake a look on this.\n\nYou will write the screenshot/e-mail in the except part, basically']"
Can someone explain this find elements behaviour?,https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/wrg9pc/can_someone_explain_this_find_elements_behaviour/,selenium,"My code will search through the html source for any instances of a particular reg ex pattern.

When it finds one, it will loop through all elements based on an xpath search for the matched reg ex pattern.

    What I'm finding weird, is one such pattern appears once on the page, yet the the xpath loop finds 9 instances of elements. Code below:
    
    for regexmatches in regexpattern.finditer(htmlsource):

How to navigate a dropdown triggered by javascript using Python Selenium,https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/whbih2/how_to_navigate_a_dropdown_triggered_by/,selenium,"[Stackoverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/73255453/edit)

    </div>


Here is what I've tried so far, all unsuccessful:

* Originally just tried finding the elements and using the .click() method to click in them. (e.g. `driver.find_element_by_xpath('//*[@id=""step-3""]/div[2]/a').click()` then `driver.find_element_by_xpath('//*[@id=""call-events-list-id""]/li[2]').click()`. Selenium could not find the list element in the second line.

* Then I tried a method that's worked for me before when the previous one didn't: finding the elements then using `driver.execute_script(""arguments[0].click()"", btn)` for each one. Like before, it worked for the main dropdown button but not the list item that should show up afterwords.

* So I figured I could just execute the javascript manually with the elements' JS paths using `driver.execute_script(""$(document.querySelector('#step-3 > div.dropdown > a')).parent().toggleClass('open');"")` then `driver.execute_script(""CallCenter.SetEvent(document.querySelector('#call-events-list-id > li:nth-child(2)'));"")`. This still didn't work and the list elements still did not show up in selenium's page source.

The strangest thing is the list elements show up in the inspector before you even click the main dropdown button. Therefore I should just be able to execute the second JS line manually with no problems, and that works fine when I do it in the browser. I have also tried just waiting for the list elements to show up when the source is loaded but they never show up no matter how long I set the delay for. 

So I am at my wit's end and could really use some help with this one.",['I think that you could try anything with keyboard...\nArrow down ...']

TouchActions touchActions = new TouchActions(driver);
touchActions.singleTap(element);

Nothing happened as if the element was never clicked. No exceptions were even logged.

I read on the javadoc that the SingleTap action and the HasTouchScreen interface (the driver implements it) are deprecated. Could this be the issue why they aren't functioning?","[""Is there a reason that you're looking to use a touch event instead of a normal click?
